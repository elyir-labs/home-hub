// What a puck needs to know to be a bridge, and how it is told.
//
// Until now all of it was compiled in from include/secrets.h: the Wi-Fi, the
// broker, the mesh keys. That is fine for a puck on a developer's desk and
// useless for one in a bag, because the hub has nothing it can WRITE to
// without a rebuild. So the config now lives in NVS and the compiled header
// is only a fallback -- the two pucks that already work keep working, and a
// board flashed from a shipped image with no secrets at all boots "blank"
// and waits to be told.
//
// It is told over the USB serial line by the hub (design/puck/Cable.dc.html:
// plug it into the hub once, the hub writes everything). Lines in, lines out,
// 115200 baud, nothing binary:
//
//   hello                              -> bridge <chip> <fw> blank|set
//   set wifi <ssid> <pass>             -> ok wifi
//   set wifi2 <ssid> <pass>            -> ok wifi2     the OTHER key on the ring; see below
//   set name <hostname>                -> ok name      the hub's name, resolved before any number
//   set mqtt <host> <port> <user> <pass>  -> ok mqtt
//   set keys <netkey> <appkey> <iv>    -> ok keys      (32 hex, 32 hex, decimal)
//   set base <base>                    -> ok base      (MQTT base, default "mesh")
//   set label <label>                  -> ok label     (the maker's word, "Brilliant")
//   set night <0|1> <0-255>            -> ok night     the nightlight, and how bright
//   set settled <0|1>                  -> ok settled   it has been placed; the instrument retires
//   status                             -> status wifi=<ip|down> mqtt=up|down proxy=<desc> switches=<n>
//   apply                              -> ok apply, then the puck restarts on the new config
//   wipe                               -> ok wipe, then it restarts blank
//
// Every free-text argument (ssid, pass, host, user, base, label) is sent HEX
// ENCODED, so a password with a space or a quote in it needs no quoting rules
// on either side. Keys are hex already. Anything the puck did not understand
// answers `err <why>`; the hub's log lines that start with `[` are noise to
// the protocol and the hub ignores them.
//
// The line reader runs on its own task, because the main loop stalls for up
// to two seconds while it hunts for a proxy and a hub writing config must not
// wait on that.

// TWO KEYS ON THE RING, AND A NAME RATHER THAN A NUMBER (docs/network.md, pieces 1 and 3).
//
// A puck used to hold one Wi-Fi and one broker address, both written once over a cable. Both went
// stale the day the house changed anything: a new router password made the puck deaf for ever, and
// a DHCP reshuffle did the same without anybody touching the Wi-Fi at all. Neither had a way back
// that was not a walk around the house with a USB lead.
//
// So the puck now holds the credentials it is using AND the ones it used before, and when it can
// reach neither it alternates between them every couple of minutes, for ever. That one change makes
// the order of a move stop mattering -- whoever arrives second finds the other already there -- and
// makes a mistyped password repair itself within minutes instead of stranding the house.
//
// The broker is found by name first (mDNS), then by the last address that actually answered, then
// by the address it was given. Any success is remembered. A house whose router filters multicast is
// caught by the second; a house that reshuffles its leases is caught by the first.
