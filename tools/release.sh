# somebody who owns the GitHub account still does not have, and it is only worth the inconvenience
# for as long as it stays somewhere GitHub cannot reach. docs/updates.md, piece 2.
#
# Run it after CI has finished publishing the tag's images: the record names them by digest, so the
# digests have to exist. Until it has run, hubs refuse that release rather than install it unchecked,
# which is the right way round but is also a reason not to leave a tag sitting unsigned.

Private key: $PRIV   (0600)
Public key:  $KEYS/$NAME.pub   — commit this; it is what hubs will trust

Three things, and they are the whole security of this:

  * Back the private key up somewhere off this machine and off GitHub. A hub that has
    installed the public half refuses every release the matching private half did not
    sign, so losing it with no second key means no hub in any house can ever be updated
    again.
  * Make a second one NOW if you are ever going to:  $0 --new-key spare
    A hub trusts the keys it was installed with and never adds one -- a key arriving from
    the repository later is exactly the push all of this exists to catch. Keep the spare
    offline, somewhere different, and never sign with it until you have to.
  * Hubs already in houses are not reached by any of this. The keys they hold are the keys
    they had on their first install.
