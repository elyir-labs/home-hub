# Nightfall, into the panel

The canvas has three artboards, and every number below is already in
[`Main.dc.html`](Main.dc.html) as working code rather than as a description of
code. When something here is vague, read the artboard: it is the spec.

The direction is a **face**, not a rewrite. A face decides what the panel is
made of; it does not decide what is on it. Everything the panel already knows —
the sky, the tone system, the layouts, the device drawings, the signals — stays
exactly where it is, and Nightfall is one more thing a house can be set to.

## Where this is

All six slices have landed, each as its own commit: `git log --oneline a2cdf1a..HEAD`.
Glass is a face a house can be set to, its material is derived from the sky, the
field carries the blooms, the rail has its focal plane, the pane has its measured
timings, and there is a floor under the whole thing. Since then: Wall, the
arrangement the board actually draws, and move 7, the command box resting down
to its orb -- both further down this section.

One measurement is still owed and cannot be taken from here, and it is worth
being clear that it **does not gate anything.** The host this is built for is a
NUC-class box; a Pi is the floor, not the target, and a face that needs more
than a Pi is not thereby a face that cannot ship. `npm run cost` is the
instrument -- point it at a real hub with `BASE=` and it prints what a rail
swipe costs in frames, under each face, on that host. Worth running on whatever
the panel actually ends up on. Not worth waiting for.

Two things were found under slice 5 rather than written by it, and both are
their own commits before it:

- **There was no frost in the built panel at all.** `panel.css` wrote
  `-webkit-backdrop-filter` by hand next to every standard `backdrop-filter`,
  and the CSS minifier reads that pair as proof the prefixed one covers every
  target: 19 of the file's 23 declarations came out of the build prefixed only.
  Chrome 153 has removed the `-webkit-` alias. So the cards, the rail, both
  panes and the whole of glass had been flat in every build for as long as that
  browser has been current, while the source plainly said blur and every unit
  test passed. The fix is to stop writing the prefix; the build adds it, and
  correctly emits both. `e2e/face.spec.ts` is the guard, and it has to be an
  e2e -- nothing that reads the stylesheet can see this, because the stylesheet
  was right.
- **The pane's close button was thirty pixels off the left of the screen.**
  `[data-face='glass'] .back` declared `position: relative` for the rim's
  containing block, which beats a plain `.opened-close`, so the button fell back
  into the flow and `right: 30px` took it the other way. A wall panel has no
  keyboard, so the veil was the only way out. The containing block belongs to
  the surface, not the face.

Run it: `cd app && npm run build && npm run mock`, then
`localhost:8399/?face=glass&layout=rail&nav=top`, or pick **Glass** under *This
house -> How it looks*. `&at=12:30&wx=sunny` is noon, `&face=paper` is the
before. Every change is scoped under `[data-face='glass']`, so paper is
untouched and that is the thing to check first if something looks wrong.

**The decision that was open is closed: there is a third arrangement now.** A
face was defined as what the panel is MADE OF, not what is on it, so the
material and the motion landed on the panel's own arrangement and the screen
still did not look much like the board. Wall is the arrangement the board draws,
and a house picks it in *This house -> How it looks* beside Stack and Rail.

What makes it is subtraction. No greeting, no house line, no next-up line,
because on a panel read from across a room the top of the screen is the most
valuable space there is and a sentence you have already read spends it. The date
it gives up was in the top bar anyway. The weather stops being a corner cloud
and takes the left third: the sky's own drawing straight onto the field with one
lozenge of glass hung in front of it, which is what gives that third depth where
a bordered box would be a tile saying what the whole screen behind it is already
saying. And the row gets the rest of the screen -- 548 tall on the board where
the Rail can only afford 392.

The row passes under the weather rather than stopping beside it, which is how
the board stacks them: the weather is drawn first and the rail after, so a
swiped card travels across it. Beside it, as a flex sibling, it could not -- a
scroller clips at its own box, so a card stopped existing at the weather's edge
and read as something with a fixed background covering it. One number in vw
does three jobs there, because all three have to agree: where the weather ends,
where the first card rests, and -- through scroll-padding, which insets the
scrollport a view() timeline measures against -- where a card starts to recede.
vw and not a percentage, because `padding` resolves a percentage against the
containing block and `scroll-padding` against the scrollport.

A card fades ACROSS the weather rather than before it, between the two edges
that matter: it holds its focus all the way to the weather's edge, goes soft
while it is crossing it, and is gone by the time it reaches the row's own edge.
That is the whole reason the sky recedes at the same time -- there has to be
something soft behind the thing going soft. It took three goes to land, and the
first two were measured and correct against the wrong edge, which is worth
knowing before someone shortens it again.

The weather recedes with the row, and that one is the layout's call rather than
the face's. In the Rail the weather is a corner element and a face can decide
whether it has depth; here it is the biggest thing on the screen, and a third of
it holding still while everything else moves reads as fixed furniture the cards
are sliding behind. So both faces dim it and take the reading away; only glass
adds the blur, because paper's softening belongs to the row's own edges.

It is the one arrangement that also brings two constants: 28px corners and Plus
Jakarta. That is a deliberate widening of the rule in `layout.ts`, written down
there -- Wall was drawn against those two numbers and in the house's own it is a
near miss rather than the thing that was drawn. Both stay scoped to
`[data-layout='wall']`, and the test that matters is the half that checks Rail
is standing exactly where it was.

The proportions are measured rather than eyeballed, because the board is a DOM:
render `nightfall-glass.html` at 1440x900, read every box as a share of its own
screen, and compare with the panel at 1280x800. What is playing sits at 34.7%
where the board has 35.1%, 23.0% wide against 23.1%; the glance column at 59.1%
against 59.7%. `e2e/wall.spec.ts` carries those numbers.

**The band no longer costs the row anything, and three things had to change for
that.** A house with something to attend to used to hand 35px of the row back,
which is the worst of both: the row got shorter and the urgent thing was no
louder for it. Pushing the row down is a weak signal -- from across a room
nobody notices a hundred pixels of reflow -- and it ties urgency to layout
damage, so the more urgent the thing, the more broken the arrangement looks.

The panel already knew the ranking and drew it flat. `App.vue` wakes the wall
when a phone asks to join and for nothing else, and `Asks.vue` carried a comment
saying that surface must look the same at every hour, because it is the one
place somebody hands out a key to the house and recognizing it instantly is the
only defense against answering a prompt they should not. Then it sat in a row
underneath "An update is ready".

So urgency is carried by SURFACE, not by how much space something steals:

| what it is | where it goes | costs the row |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| someone is waiting -- a phone at the door | a pane that opens itself (`AskPane.vue`) | nothing |
| something is broken -- what has stopped answering | a chip opening a page of This house (`NotesPage.vue`) | nothing |
| something is offered -- an update, a found device, the lock | a quiet chip in the band | nothing |

With those two out of the band, nothing left in it is taller than one line of
house news -- and a band of a known height need not take part in the layout at
all. It comes out of the flow and hangs in the gap that is already there: the
stage centers in whatever height is left, which leaves 58px between the top bar
and the row at 1280x800, and a chip is 57. `--stage-top` is named where it is
declared, because the band starts at the BAR rather than at the stage's content
box and the two have to agree. It never grows: one line, no wrapping, one line
of sub, and a fourth thing to attend to scrolls sideways, because a band that
can grow is a row that can shrink.

The row lands at a fixed 142 whatever is in the band, which puts the card at 150
against the board's 160 -- 1.25% of the screen, inside the 1.5% every other
proportion in `e2e/wall.spec.ts` is held to. Chasing the last ten would mean
giving up `margin-block: auto`, and with it the thing that keeps this
arrangement sane on a screen that is not 800 tall.

Two notes on the ask pane, because both are the kind of thing someone will want
to undo. Its color does NOT track the sky, which is the only surface in the
file that does not, and `e2e/ask.spec.ts` is the only test in the suite that
wants two hours to come out identical -- a surface a person is meant to
recognize cannot look different at every hour. That would normally be the hole
punched in the daylight slice 5 closed, except that the room behind a pane is
already taken down by `--glass-scrim`, so a dark pane is not sitting in a bright
room, it IS the room being out of the way. And the way out of it is *aside*
rather than *deny*: the knock stays standing and the chip in the band brings the
pane back, because a person who wants to look at something else first must not
have to choose between denying a phone and being stuck.

**Move 7 is in, and it was the last one no slice had built.** On the board the
command box down in the bottom bar is a single orb until it is touched: 460ms of
width opens it with the words 180ms behind, so the box is already the right size
by the time there is anything to read in it. Shutting, the delay is gone -- the
words leave first and the width follows them home, because a box closing on its
own contents reads as a mistake rather than as a move.

Two things had to land with it. **The box was never made of anything.** Slice 2's
material reached the cards, the panes and the lozenge and never came down here,
so under glass the command box was still wearing paper's near-black with paper's
frost on it, and so were the four things it says back. And the orb is drawn
rather than tinted -- four blooms behind a blur, turning against each other at
14s and 19s, which is what separates a thing that is listening from a button
with a gradient on it. That needs two elements, so the orb stops being a
`::before`; it is hidden everywhere but the bar, because a box at the top of the
stage is a field you type in and keeps its sparkle.

What the face does NOT take is the board's 430px open width, 382 at this size.
That pill has no Go button in it, and taking 78px off the words to reach a number
would be a face moving a control, which `layout.ts` says it may not. The open
width stays the layout's 460. Nor is the strand dropped: the orb IS the command
box, one tap from being typed in, and the input behind it never leaves the tab
order -- reaching it is what opens the box, so a keyboard never meets a shut one.
`Say.vue` holds the single fact of whether it is open, because the stylesheet
must not have to work out for itself whether there is a sentence in flight or an
answer nobody has read.

The pill lifts as it opens with a background-COLOR and not a filter, which
would form a backdrop root and take the box's own frost away at the instant it
opened. Third time this file has had to say that, after the rail's blur and the
room behind a pane.

**The reduced-motion guard was right to stop this, and it is the interesting
part.** `e2e/face.spec.ts` holds the whole face to no `filter` anywhere, and the
orb's blooms are painted THROUGH one. They are now named as the one static
filter in the face: a filter only moves something if something is happening to
it, and under reduced motion the turn -- the whole of the vestibular part -- is
what has been taken away. Everything else is still held to none. Naming the
exception in the guard is the honest version; painting the orb without the blur
to get past it would have changed the material for a reason that has nothing to
do with motion.

Two things found by measuring rather than by looking. `busy` disables the input
while a sentence is with the brain, which drops focus, and nothing was giving it
back -- so after every command a keyboard was left outside the box, which on a
wall panel means summoning an on-screen one twice to say two things. That is a
fix on its own account and is its own commit before the move. And the bar sits
30px off the bottom where the board's 52 scales to 46; the orb lands at 92.8% of
the screen's height against the board's 91.0%. Left alone on purpose: that
padding is shared by both faces and all three arrangements, and a face moving it
is exactly the quiet widening this page keeps warning about.

`npm run cost` is unchanged -- 30 frames against paper's 40, the same numbers as
before -- so an orb turning for ever costs nothing a swipe can see.

## The seam

`toneVars(elevation, condition, tone)` in [`tone.ts`](../../app/src/tone.ts)
already turns *what the sky is doing* into *the custom properties the panel
paints with*, and the shell binds the result as a style so every card inherits
it. That is the whole hook. Nightfall adds properties to that object; it does
not add a second way of coloring anything.

`LookPage.vue` already picks a tone, a layout and a nav, and each is a short
table with an `is*()` guard and a test that every entry has a name and a line
saying who it is for. A face is a fourth table of exactly that shape.

## Slices, in an order where each one lands on its own

Each of these is meant to be committed and looked at before the next one
starts. Nothing below needs the slice after it to be worth having.

**1. `face` exists and does nothing.** *(landed)*  `FACES` in `layout.ts` (`paper` — what
the panel is today — and `glass`), an `isFace()` guard, the row in `LookPage`,
the field on `ambient.look`, and the same round-trip through the brain the
other three take. Done when picking it changes a `data-face` attribute on the
shell and nothing else moves.

**2. The material.** *(landed)*  `toneVars` gains the glass block when `face === 'glass'`,
derived from the `ground(el, condition)` it already computes:

| property        | value                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--glass`       | three-stop 148deg, `oklch(ground.L + .10 … / .34 → .12)`     |
| `--rim`         | 158deg, catch `.74 → .40`, shadow `.02 → .20`, as `bright` runs `0 → 1` |
| `--inner`       | `inset 0 -46px 56px -48px` the sky's top band, darkened      |
| `--drop`        | tightens and lightens as the day lightens                    |
| `--sweep`       | `.15 → .07`                                                 |
| `--glass-sat`   | `1.7 → 1.15`                                                |

where `bright = clamp((ground.L - .18) / .34)`. The rim swapping ends is the
part that matters: on a dark field you see the catch along the top, at noon the
shadow under the foot, which is what glass does. `panel.css` reads these instead
of its literals under `[data-face="glass"]`; the existing warm tokens are left
alone. `tone.test.ts` is where this is held honest — the glass L has to track
`ground.L` at every hour and the rim has to invert past `bright` .5.

**3. The field.** *(landed)*  `Sky.vue` already paints the ramp and the veil. Under `glass`
it also lays the four blooms on at low alpha — character, not lightness. The
lightness must stay the sky's own, because `ground()` is what every card is
measured against and a field painted darker than `ground` makes every distance
in the system a lie. That was the one real mistake of the daylight pass; do not
repeat it.

Landed, with one thing found. This panel's sky is a painted scene — a ramp, a
horizon, rolling ground under it, stars, drifting cloud — where the face was
drawn against an abstract field. Blooms laid on a scene read as a tint rather
than as the field, which is why the difference between paper and glass is
quieter in the app than it is on the canvas. Whether glass wants the landscape
suppressed, or wants these carried inside the canvas rather than over it, is a
design call nobody has made.

**4. The rail.** *(landed)*  The biggest slice, and the one with the idea in it. `rail`
layout already sweeps; what it does not have is a focal plane. Depth is one
idea, not three — further back is blurrier, dimmer **and** slower:

- the cards travel 1:1, the card just passed gives back a third of the travel
  so the one in focus overtakes and covers it, and the sky gives back nearly
  all of it
- what has gone past goes to `blur(5px)` at `.6`; the sky to `blur(5px)` at
  `.8`, and the readout hung in front of it fades out entirely
- on top, small: `blur(2.5px)`, 150ms in and 500ms off, so even the cards that
  end sharp are soft in the middle of the move

**The blur goes on each card, never on the rail.** A `filter` on an ancestor
forms a backdrop root, which silently kills `backdrop-filter` on everything
beneath it, and the glass goes flat mid-swipe. Same reason the wake's
`animation-fill-mode` is `backwards` and not `both`.

Landed, and it needed almost no new machinery: the rail already drives its edges
from `animation-timeline: view(inline)`, so glass only swaps which keyframes
those two animations run. Paper softens both ends even-handedly; glass does not,
because a focal plane is not even-handed. The lag is `transform` rather than
`translate` because `translate` belongs to the arrival, and those two have
always deliberately stayed off each other's properties.

The weather recedes without being in the rail to know it should — it stays put,
blurs, and drops the reading. That is what the row's own `data-at-start` is now
kept true for on every browser rather than only the ones without scroll-driven
animations.

The lag is a share of the card, not a count of pixels: the row runs from a 248px
glance column to a 372px media card, so a fixed number overlaps the wide ones
barely and the narrow ones twice as much. 45% of the card, less the row's 18px
gap, puts coverage at 50 -> 99 -> 130px through the exit.

One thing that does NOT fix, and it is worth knowing before someone tries again:
the overlap is a during-the-swipe effect, not a resting one. The row snaps to
card boundaries, so once it settles nothing is mid-exit and the receded card
sits entirely behind its neighbor. The reference rests mid-card, which is why
the stack stands still in the drawing. Making it persist at rest means changing
where the rail stops, which is a decision about the rail rather than the face.

The velocity blur is **not** in. It is a second blur on top of one the file
already warns re-rasterises every frame of a swipe, and adding that cost before
slice 6 has measured the first one is backwards. It waits for a number.

**5. The pane.** *(landed)*  `Opened.vue` already rose; it needed the measured timings.
400ms up on `cubic-bezier(.12,.78,.24,1)`, 300ms down on
`cubic-bezier(.4,0,.6,1)`, the object inside traveling further and still
settling at 700ms, the bottom bar leaving 60ms *before* the pane starts and
coming back 180ms after it has gone. The pane stops short of the top bar so the
row you came from is still there, dimmed, above it -- that is what makes it a
drawer rather than a new screen. The room dims; it does not blur.

Landed in three commits, because the timings could not be looked at until the
pane was made of something.

*The room dims; it does not blur* turned out to have a second reason underneath
the stated one. A pane over an already-blurred room is a dark sheet over mush --
the blur the pane is MADE of has nothing left to work on -- and the dim cannot
be a `filter` either, because a filter on `.stage` forms a backdrop root and
silently kills `backdrop-filter` on every card beneath it. It is the same trap
as the rail's blur, which goes on each card and never on the row. So the room
stays where it is and `--glass-scrim` takes it down: the air from under the
pane, deepening as the day does, because a dark room is already most of the way
to being out of the way and a bright one is not.

*A pane is measured against the room, not the sky.* Both panes were still
wearing paper's fixed near-black, invisible while the room behind them was mush
and, once it was not, exactly the hole punched in the daylight `tone.ts` exists
to prevent: at noon the room read L .49 and the pane .13. A card under glass
holds its distance from the sky; a pane does not, because by the time you are
looking at one the sky is not what is behind it. `--pane` is written as what it
does to the scrimmed room -- each stop says how far it lifts what is behind it,
and the painted lightness falls out of that and the stop's own alpha.

The lifts are small, and it took measuring to find out how small. Lifted a
card's distance, at noon the pane is a pale blue sheet with gray type on it: the
muted ink came off the screen at 2.0:1 against paper's 4.4:1 at the same hour.
Which is the other half -- the surface moved, so the ink has to move with it,
the same as on a card. `--pane-ink-2` and `--pane-muted` hold a ratio against
the pane's own foot rather than a color, and never drop below what paper gives,
so after dark nothing changes at all. Measured back off the screen at noon:
6.1:1 and 4.7:1.

*The timings* needed a real instant to count from, twice, and neither existed.
`shown` cannot flip until the pane has painted once at `translateY(100%)`, two
frames after the bar starts leaving, so the pane's delay is 28ms and those two
frames are the rest of the 60. And the way back used to be counted from
`Opened.vue`'s unmount timeout, which is a `setTimeout` on the same main thread
that is painting a 300ms fall through a 30px blur and runs about 70ms late; a
`closing` flag goes on at the instant the fall begins instead. It is a separate
fact from `!shown` and has to be, because for two frames at the start a pane is
also not shown and CSS cannot tell those apart.

Measured off the transitions' own clocks rather than by sampling frames -- at
1280x800 a frame runs about 25ms while a pane is being painted, which is coarser
than the gaps involved. Bar at 0, veil at 25, pane at 51, landed at 480, the
object still going until 760. The test asserts the ORDER, because that is what
breaks silently and the numbers are load-dependent.

One part of the slice did not land at the time, and it has since: **the row you
came from is now still there above the pane.** It was written up here as the
arrangement's problem rather than the face's, and that was right. The pane
stopped short of the top BAR -- 176px at 1280x800 -- but home led with a serif
greeting, a next-up line and the attention strip, so the row did not begin until
y 340 and the pane covered all of it.

Wall took the first three away and the band above (see *Where this is*) took the
last one out of the flow, so the row now starts at 142 and a pane can stop short
of the ROW instead: 25vh where it was 22, which is the board's own 56 of 900 --
the top of a card and its corner -- at this size. That is the whole difference
between a drawer and a new screen, and it needed the arrangement to exist before
the number could mean what it said.

**6. Reduced motion, and the floor.** *(landed, except the Pi)*  All eight moves collapse to
opacity, the field stops drifting, the rail jumps. Then the question this whole
port exists to answer: a Pi 5 at 1280×800, painting `backdrop-filter` on every
card with an animated `filter` on five of them at once. If it will not hold, the
honest answer is that the blur is sized to the host the way everything else is,
and `glass` degrades to a flat tint on the floor rather than the whole face
being abandoned.

*Reduced motion* was almost already true, and checked in a browser rather than
assumed: the blanket block near the top of `panel.css` leaves no animation, no
filter and no transition anywhere under either face, and `Sky.vue` draws its
scene once instead of starting a loop. One thing was a step too far. The rail
did not arm its arrival at all, so the row appeared between two frames, where
the canvas asks for a 180ms fade -- a fade is not vestibular motion, a pop is
only abrupt. The rail now arms it either way and the stylesheet decides what
arriving means, which is the point: a move and its reduced form drifting apart
is what happens when that decision lives in two files. The travel has to be
canceled explicitly, because `translate` is a plain property and the blanket
block does nothing to it -- otherwise every card sits 696px right for one
painted frame, which is the move this is supposed to remove.

*The floor,* and the measurement reframes it. **Both faces paint the same 13
frosted surfaces** at 1280x800. Paper has always put `--frost` on every tile;
glass adds none. The whole difference is the radius -- 26px against 18 -- plus a
saturate, and on the rail an animated 5px blur where paper animates 6. So the
risk was never whether a host can blur. It is how wide, and that is one number:
`--glass-blur`, with `--pane-blur` beside it.

What `npm run cost` measures at 1280x800 with software rasterisation, which is
the nearest thing to a weak GPU available without one: a 650ms rail swipe holds
every frame under paper and drops about a quarter of them under glass,
repeatably. A radius bill, not a face bill.

The floor itself is built regardless, because there is one state the face could
not survive: a host with no `backdrop-filter` at all. An unblurred glass card is
.34 of a color over the open sky and hardly a card -- the face would not
degrade, it would vanish. `--glass-flat` and `--pane-flat` are not a second
palette; each stop is the color its translucent twin composites TO, so the rim,
the sweep and the shadow are all still drawn and only the depth is gone.
`data-flat` carries it rather than `@supports`, for two reasons: a feature query
cannot be switched on to look at, and this is a state the panel will spend its
whole life never being in, so nobody would ever see it -- `?flat=1` does. And
the switch has a second job waiting, because a host that CAN blur but not fast
enough wants exactly the same answer, and that is a measurement rather than a
feature query.

## What is still open

The direction survives the day — the Sky chip on the canvas is the proof, and
the material sheet computes the argument: the band a card sits on runs L .140 at
night to L .492 at noon and nothing inverts across it. But at clear noon this is
a bright blue panel, and the indigo, the inner glow and the orb are an evening
identity. Whether that wants a distinct day face or just this one tracking
lightness is a design decision nobody has made yet, and it does not block
anything above.

Slice 5 put a number on one corner of that. A pane at noon cannot be both lit
glass and carry paper's grays: to give the muted ink paper's 4.4:1 it would have
to come down to a near-black sheet, which is the hole punched in the daylight
all over again. The pane carries its own ink instead, which is the house's own
rule and holds — but it is worth knowing that the day question is not only about
identity. It has a legibility floor under it, and that floor is what decides how
light a pane is allowed to be.

That floor has now been measured, and it is not a pane question at all: it is
`--card-ink-2`. At `?at=12:30&wx=sunny`, with the ink composited over the ground
at its own alpha and the ground read from behind the ink itself, the secondary
line on three unrelated surfaces comes out at:

| | glass | paper |
| --- | --- | --- |
| what a lamp is doing | 2.74 | 3.34 |
| the line under a scene | 2.96 | 3.28 |
| under the weather | 4.27 | 3.43 |

The primary ink beside each of those is 6.9 to 7.7 on both faces, so nothing is
wrong with the flip and nothing is wrong with either face -- the two track each
other everywhere, which is the invariant to keep. What is thin is
`rgba(30,27,36,.62)` on a card that daylight has taken to L .7: .62 of an alpha
was chosen against the dark card it sits on after sunset, where the same ink
reads 4.6 to 5.6. It is one number in `toneVars` and it belongs to whoever
answers the day question, because raising it changes paper everywhere in
daylight and that is a design decision rather than a fix.

Two ways to get these numbers wrong, both found the hard way and both surviving
a screenshot. Reading an ink as if it were opaque: `--card-ink-2` scored 6.90
where it paints 3.26. And reading the ground from a point that is not behind the
ink -- beside a clamped line it lands outside the surface on the open sky, and
with the rail left mid-scroll it lands on whichever card is passing over. Hide
the text and clip its own rect; put the row back to home first.

The other unbuilt thing is a screen that is not a rail. A room fits on the
screen, so [`Room.dc.html`](../Room.dc.html) argues it is a ranked grid rather
than something you sweep — and rail-plus-pane is the spine of this direction.
Whether it has an answer there is genuinely unknown.

With all six slices in, Wall built, move 7 landed and the band out of the flow,
what is left is not really port work any more. Of the eight moves the canvas
names, seven are in; the eighth, **move 6, Listening**, has nowhere to live yet
because there is no voice. It is the orb's own move -- scale 1.18, 320ms in,
520ms out, one ring, once -- and the orb now exists, so the move is waiting on
the feature rather than on the port. The Pi number is a half-hour on the right machine whenever someone wants
it, and it gates nothing. Everything else on this page is a design decision:
whether the day wants a face of its own, whether the sky should suppress its
landscape under glass, and whether a room is a rail at all. The face is
finished, the arrangement it was drawn as exists, and every one of those can be
answered without touching either.

Move 7 put one more thing under the day question rather than settling it. The
orb carries colors of its own instead of a distance from the sky, which is the
one place in the face that does -- deliberately, because a lit object is not a
surface, and it is the license the lamp glow and the weather drawing already
have. What it means is that the orb is an EVENING identity: indigo at noon as
much as at midnight. The bottom band of the sky is dark enough at every hour
that it reads, so nothing is broken; but if the day ever gets a face of its own,
the orb is on the list.

The `data-flat` switch is the one seam left half-used. It is wired to the
question a browser can answer -- can this host paint a backdrop-filter -- and
waiting on the one only a measurement can: can it paint one fast enough. If the
Pi says no, that is where the answer goes, and the step before a flat tint is a
smaller `--glass-blur` rather than no glass at all.

## How this work has been going, for whoever picks it up

Small slices, each committed and looked at before the next one starts. The
panel is checked by driving the real thing at 1280x800 against `mock/brain.mjs`
and reading computed styles, not by trusting that the CSS says what it means --
the rail's 56px lag was confirmed by measuring an exiting card at x -294 under
glass against -350 under paper. Slice 5 needed two instruments past that, and
both are worth keeping. For color, screenshot a clip of the pane and read the
pixels back, because a composite of a gradient over a blurred backdrop is not
anywhere in the computed styles -- that is where 2.0:1 came from, and nothing
else would have found it. For timing, listen for `transitionstart` and
`transitionend` rather than sampling frames: a frame runs about 25ms while a
pane is being painted, which is coarser than the gaps being measured, and a
sampled trace put the bar and the pane at the same instant when they are 51ms
apart. For cost, `npm run cost` -- a scripted rail swipe with the gaps between
presented frames written down, and the only one of these meant to be run
somewhere other than here.

For a move shorter than a screenshot, sample it per frame from inside the page:
move 7's width and its words were read off `getBoundingClientRect` and
`getComputedStyle` on every `requestAnimationFrame` of the 460ms, and the spec
asserts their ORDER rather than their durations, which is the same lesson the
pane's timings taught.

And for composition, the board itself. `nightfall-glass.html` is a published
canvas, which means it is a DOM: serve the folder, open it in a browser, and
read every box out of the artboard frame as a share of its own screen. Comparing
numbers against numbers found a card a quarter too wide and a pane at the wrong
end of its column, neither of which had looked wrong in a screenshot. `npx vitest run`, `npx playwright test`,
`npx vue-tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json` and `npx eslint` all pass; the hold
gesture spec flakes under load and passes in isolation.

Findings get written down rather than tuned away. The blooms read as a tint
because the panel's sky is a painted scene and the face was drawn against an
abstract field -- that is in slice 3 as a question, not fixed by raising an
alpha until it looked right. The same goes for the last 9ms of the pane's 60ms
lead: it is one frame, chasing it moved the measurement the wrong way, and the
comment in `panel.css` says so instead of pretending to 60.

And check the built panel, not the dev server. The frost bug above only exists
after minification, so `npm run dev` shows a face that `npm run build` does
not.
