// What keeps a rev A strip controller from hurting itself, a strip, or a house -- on the board, with
// nobody asking.
//
// THE BOX TAKES ANY SUPPLY FROM 5 TO 24 V AND CANNOT KNOW WHAT IS PLUGGED INTO ITS RUNS. A 12 V strip
// given a 24 V supply is a strip on fire, and the board has no way to ask a strip what it is. What it
// can do is notice a CHANGE: it measures the supply before either run is switched on, remembers what
// each run was first lit on, and on any later boot refuses to light a run whose supply is now a
// different kind. The hardware's own cutoffs (below 4.2 V, above 30.1 V) are a second line under
// this one, not the line.
//
// AND IT DIMS RATHER THAN TRIPS. Each run's switch cuts at 5.07 A at the low end of its tolerance and
// retries 650 ms later, which from across a room is a light that flashes off and on. So the firmware
// predicts each frame's current from its pixels before it is sent, sends it dimmed if it would draw
// too much, and corrects the prediction from what the switch's current monitor actually reads. The
// trip is there for a short circuit; it is never the thing that holds a bright picture down.
//
// Nothing here relies on the hub, and nothing here waits for it: a strip in a house whose hub is down
// is exactly as safe. The hub is only TOLD (`power`, below), so the wall can say why a run is dark.
//
// The arithmetic is above the line and free of ESP-IDF, so test_guard_native.cpp holds it to the
// numbers on a Mac. guard.cpp is the half that reads pins.

// which thing is asking to be set up, and the board cannot tell a 12 V strip from a 24 V one before
// it is lit. So it is the first lighting that fixes what the run expects; after that a different kind
// of supply leaves it dark and says why. Forgetting the house -- the hold on the button, or the panel

//               part draws per channel whatever its supply, because a 12 V or 24 V part puts its
//               LEDs in series rather than drawing more; it is learned UP at once and DOWN slowly,
//               because a strip that draws more than was thought is the one that trips.
//   `idle`      amps for the whole run showing black. A WS2812B is about a milliamp dark, which at a
