// What goes down the wire, and the two things about a strip nobody can ask it.
//
// A WS2812-family strip has one data line and no way back: it is write-only, on every part in this
// family. So the controller cannot discover how long the strip is, and cannot discover which order
// the strip wants its colors in. Both are settled by SHOWING something and having a person say what
// they can see (design/strip/Order.dc.html, design/strip/Fill.dc.html), and both answers arrive here
// over MQTT from the hub and live in NVS afterwards.
//
// EVERYTHING IN THIS HEADER IS FREE OF Arduino, ON PURPOSE. It is the part that is easy to get subtly
// wrong and impossible to notice on a bench -- a strip with its red and green swapped looks like it
// is working -- so it compiles on a Mac and is checked against the brain's own arithmetic
// (test_pixels_native.cpp, and brain/hub/strip.py). The RMT writing lives in pixels.cpp, which is
// where the Arduino include is.

// The most lights one controller will drive. Not a software limit and not a limit anybody should
// meet: a 5 m strip at 60/m is 300, and somewhere past that the 5 V rail is what gives out, not this.
// It also sets the RMT symbol buffer in pixels.cpp -- 600 rgbw pixels is 76 KB of symbols, which is
// already a lot to ask of a part that is holding Matter and Wi-Fi at the same time.
