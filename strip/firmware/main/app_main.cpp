// A light strip controller: a Matter device in its own right, and a little more in a house with our hub.
//
// WHY THIS IS ESP-IDF AND NOT ARDUINO, because it was Arduino first and the hardware settled it. The
// Arduino framework ships its Matter libraries with CONFIG_ENABLE_CHIPOBLE unset on every target, so
// a strip built that way never advertises itself for commissioning: it has to be on the Wi-Fi
// already and be found over mDNS. Which means a household with an Apple TV and no hub of ours could
// not set one up at all. An evening went on a strip that would not pair, a BLE scan that found
// fifty-nine devices and not ours, and finally the same board running esp-matter's own example
// saying "CHIPoBLE advertising started" with nothing configured. docs/strip.md has both scans.
//
// So Matter carries the Wi-Fi credentials and the commissioning, in one encrypted flow, and the
// hand-rolled provisioning this firmware started with -- which put a household's Wi-Fi password on
// an open BLE link -- is gone rather than fixed.
//
// TWO WAYS TO OWN ONE, and the first is the whole product on its own:
//
//   Any Matter hub    commission it with the code. It is a color light: on, off, dim, any color, any
//                     warmth, in whatever app the household already has. Nothing of ours is involved.
//   Our hub as well   the same, plus the two questions Matter has no words for -- which order its
//                     colors come out in, and how far it goes -- over MQTT. A strip with no broker in
//                     its settings simply does not do this half and is none the worse for it.
//
// WHAT MATTER CANNOT SAY: the Extended Color Light is one color for the whole fitting. It has no
// concept of a pixel, so the setup instruments and anything spatial are ours and always will be.
// That is the same split Hue and Nanoleaf run and it is not a compromise.
//
// THE LIGHT NEVER REPORTS A FAULT BY CHANGING COLOR. This is the one place a strip is the opposite of
// the bridge puck. docs/puck-light.md puts a fault above a puck's light, because a puck glowing while
// its bridge is down is furniture that lies. A strip is behind somebody's television while they watch
// a film: turning it amber because a broker blinked is the product breaking, not reporting.
