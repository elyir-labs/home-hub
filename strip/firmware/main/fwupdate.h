// Taking a new image from the hub, and going back to the old one if it does not work.
//
// The puck's design, on a strip (docs/strip.md, "Updates, the puck's way"; the puck's half is
// puck/src/fwupdate.h, and both follow docs/puck-updates.md). The hub OFFERS over
// the broker -- the authenticated channel, whose credentials it handed over at setup -- and names the
// image by its SHA-256, so only the bytes travel over plain HTTP from the hub's own port.
//
//   strip/<chip>/offer    <- <fw> <size> <sha256> <port> <path>    retained, from the hub; "" withdraws
//   strip/<chip>/fw       -> <fw>                                  retained, on every connect
//   strip/<chip>/update   -> {"state":..., "fw":..., "why":...}    not retained
//        state: fetching | refused | failed | installed | rolledback
//
// A new image boots unconfirmed and confirms itself only when the strip is doing its job -- an address,
// the broker, and a light driver that started. Otherwise it asks the bootloader to take it back, which
// needs CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE in the bootloader a cable put there. The highest version
// it has confirmed is a floor, and a version that came back twice is not taken again.
