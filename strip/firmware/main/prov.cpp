// See prov.h for why this file exists at all. What follows is the shape of it, because the ordering
// is the part that is easy to get wrong:
//
//   at boot      reserve() builds a GATT service and hands it to CHIP, which merges it in beside
//                CHIPoBLE. The endpoint NAMES are not known yet -- only how many there will be and
//                what their sixteen-bit ids are, which network_provisioning fixes -- so the table is
//                built from ids alone and the names are served later, at read time.
//   later        network_prov_mgr_start_provisioning() calls our prov_start with a live protocomm
//                instance and the name-to-id table it built. Nothing is registered here; the
//                characteristics already exist. All prov_start does is make them answer.
//
// The reason for that split is a hard edge in CHIP: ConfigureExtraServices returns
// CHIP_ERROR_INCORRECT_STATE once its own service list is non-empty, and that happens inside
// esp_matter::start(), long before anybody asks to be provisioned.
