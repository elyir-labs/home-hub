"""The hub, current: one command that always leaves you running the code you just wrote.

`npm run brain` from the panel's directory, or `.venv/bin/python dev.py` from here.

There are two ways to end up developing against a hub that is not your code, and this handles both.
The first is the hub that is still running from an hour ago -- the silent one, because it serves an
older shape of /ambient or /home, the panel renders it without complaint, and the result looks like
a panel bug. The second is what you get for noticing: you start a new one, the old one still holds
the port, and uvicorn says `[Errno 48] Address already in use`, which does not tell you which
process or what to do about it.

So this stops what is there, says what it stopped and how long it had been up, and starts a fresh
one with the reloader on. From then on every edit under hub/ restarts it by itself.

It will only ever stop a hub of OURS -- a python running this project's main.py or dev.py. Anything
else on the port is reported and left alone: on a machine running the brain from docker-compose,
the process holding 8300 is docker's proxy, and killing that would take out the container's
networking rather than the hub.
