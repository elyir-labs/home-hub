"""A brain to make requests against, with no engine behind it and nothing on disk that outlives the test.

The routes in hub/api.py reach for one module-level `hub`, so a test gets its own by building a Hub
with its settings and event log pointed at a temp directory and putting that in the module's place.
Nothing here starts the lifecycle loop: TestClient only runs lifespan inside a `with`, and every test
below wants a house that holds still rather than one that reconnects underneath it.
