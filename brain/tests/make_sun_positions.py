"""Regenerate tests/sun-positions.json, the table both sun implementations are held to.

Run from brain/: .venv/bin/python tests/make_sun_positions.py

Only run this when the math is meant to change. The point of the file is that it does not move on
its own: brain/hub/sun.py and app/src/sun.ts are the same calculation written twice, and the panel's
sky and the brain's after-dark rules disagreeing is the bug it exists to catch.
