"""Live video for the viewer.

Two ways, best first. WebRTC: the panel's offer and HA's answer cross here, then the browser and
HA's go2rtc talk to each other directly; the brain never sees a frame. Motion JPEG: HA's
`camera_proxy_stream` passed through one chunk at a time, for cameras HA cannot hand to go2rtc and
browsers that cannot do WebRTC. Stills (`/devices/{id}/image`) remain the floor under both, and
`Frames` below dates them: a still is only as new as the frame HA happens to be holding.

    those bytes first appeared is kept; the same bytes keep their first time however often they are
    asked for, and the panel is told how old they are rather than left to guess.

    The age is "unchanged for", which is only a lower bound on the age of the picture: a hub that has
    just started has not been watching long enough to know a frame is old, and says so a few minutes
    later once the frame has not moved. The camera never tells anybody when it took the picture.
