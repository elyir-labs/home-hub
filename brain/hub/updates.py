"""Updates that explain themselves.

The brain knows which build it is (baked into its image by CI), asks GitHub now and then whether
there is a newer one, and tells the panel when there is. Installing is the host's job: the panel's
tap writes a request file into the data volume, a systemd path unit on the host sees it and runs
install.sh, which brings the code to the newest release, pulls the images and restarts everything;
update.json in the same volume says how it went. The brain never runs docker itself and never
restarts anything on its own.

The host also undoes an update that does not come back: it records where the hub was, waits for the
brain to answer on the loopback and keep answering, and otherwise puts the old commit and the old
image back. What arrives here is a fourth state, `reverted`, naming the version that did it -- which
is the one thing this module has to act on, because a rollback followed six hours later by the same
install is a loop rather than a safety net. See docs/updates.md, piece 1.

Three channels, because a hub in someone's house and the hub on the developer's desk want different
things. `release` (the default, and what every hub ships as) follows version tags: nothing reaches a
family until it is tagged. `main` and `development` follow those branches, commit by commit, which is
what a hub being worked on wants -- `development` being the one day-to-day work lands on, and `main`
what is about to be tagged. install.sh writes HUB_CHANNEL into the compose environment; nothing else
chooses.
