"""Who is home. Read from HA's person entities and the alarm's mode; the house has no other way to know.

People decide when there are any: somebody is home if any person is, nobody if every person is away. The
alarm overrides in one direction: armed away means nobody, whatever a phone still claims. With no people,
disarmed or armed home means somebody. Anything else (arming, pending, triggered, unavailable) leaves the
last answer standing. Before there is any answer at all `somebody` is None and presence rules never fire.
