"""Finishing the driver layer without anyone opening Home Assistant.

docker-compose.yml puts each rented part at a fixed address. When a part answers, the brain adds its
integration to HA itself: it walks the same config flow the panel would draw, with the answers filled
in. This runs on connect and then every half minute, so a radio plugged in later is picked up too, and
the panel is told what was found in plain words (`drivers` in /setup/status).
