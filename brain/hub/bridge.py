"""A bridge puck on the hub's cable, and the bridges the house already has.

A bridge is a small thing on a USB charger that brings in devices the hub has no radio of its own
for -- today the wall switches on the Brilliant mesh (puck). Setting one up is
design/puck/Cable.dc.html: plug it into the hub once, the hub gives it everything -- its software if
it has none, the Wi-Fi, the broker, the keys to the switches -- and then says where to put it. The
panel draws the state this module hands it (app/src/BridgeSheet.vue) and sends back the two answers
a person can give: yes that one is mine, and leave it here.

One job at a time, because it is a person holding a thing.

    none      nothing to say
    knocking  a puck is on the cable and nobody has said it is theirs. Nothing of the house's has
              gone anywhere: the code gate on /bridge/adopt (hub/lock.py) is what "nothing has been
              let in" means. Saying it is not yours needs no code -- refusing gives nothing away
    working   `step` is software | wifi | keys, in that order; everything before it is done
    placing   written and restarted; unplugged now, in somebody's hand, looking for a socket. What
              it hears comes back over the broker, which is the only link left
    ready     placed. `switches` came in with it; `unplaced` of them have no room yet
    failed    `text` says why, in words for the wall

The serial side (pyserial, esptool) is behind `Cable`, so the machine is tested with a fake one
and nothing here needs a puck to run.

Bridges the house already has are learned from the broker, not from the cable: every puck publishes
`<base>/bridge/<chip>/status` (retained, online|offline), `.../net` (the mesh it carries) and
`.../proxy` (the switch it is linked to, and how strongly); the switches under `<base>/<net>/<addr>/`
are counted per net. This subscribes through the engine's own MQTT link, the way pairing.py does.

        Two things go to the puck, and they are NOT sent the same way, which is the whole of this
        method (docs/puck-light.md):

        `settled` is the hub's to own. It says the thing has a home, it never changes afterwards, and
        until the puck has it the light stays an instrument -- green, still asking "is here good?".
        So it goes RETAINED: a puck that was offline at this exact moment, or that is wiped and
        flashed again in the same corner, picks it up on its next connect. Replaying it is harmless
        because it is idempotent, and `forget()` clears it, which is what stops a bridge that was
        sent away coming back believing it is still placed.

        `night` is the HOUSEHOLD's, the moment after they answer. It goes once, NOT retained, and the
        hub never says it again. The puck keeps it in NVS and Home Assistant owns it from here -- so
        somebody turning the nightlight off in February is not overruled by a placement answer from
        September the next time the puck reboots. That failure would be invisible and maddening, and
        not retaining is the whole fix.

        A puck that is offline right now therefore keeps its green and loses only the nightlight,
        which is the right way round: the instrument survives, the decoration does not.
