"""Health in plain words. The facts are already in the house: which devices have gone quiet and since when
(the event log), how full the hub's storage is, which driver parts want attention, whether the last update
finished. This turns them into a short list for one quiet place on the panel.

It used to only say. A page of nine true sentences with two buttons on it is a report, and a person who
opens it because the panel told them eight things need a look has been handed a report and no way out of
it. So two rules turn a sentence into a job.

**A fault is said once.** A radio that stops answering takes everything on it quiet with it, and a house
that reports that eight times has buried the one thing worth doing. The fault is the line; what went
quiet behind it rides along in `with`, named, so a person can see it is their front door and their
dimmer and not wonder. Fix the radio and the eight go together. This is why a device carries the entry
that brought it (model.Device.entry) and why Provision keeps what each entry is (Provision.domains):
without those two the panel can only show effects and never the cause.

**Every line carries what can be done about it,** in `acts`: `{do, act, to}`, and `ask`/`yes` where the
doing is worth a second's thought first -- the question and the words that answer it, both with the name
in them, because "Are you sure?" is not a question anybody can answer. The panel draws them as buttons and invents none of its own, because
it does not know what it is looking at. An empty `acts` is a line worth saying and not worth tapping --
which should be rare, and where it is not, the thing to fix is here rather than in the panel.
