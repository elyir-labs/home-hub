"""3D printers in the house: found on the Wi-Fi, let in at the printer, and followed. docs/printers.md.

A printer here is anything that speaks a printer door's small public protocol: `/door/me` says it is a
printer and where it lives, `/door/ask` asks to be let in and somebody at the printer says yes, and a
token then opens Moonraker's websocket behind it. The hub knows printers; a printer never knows the hub,
and nothing here imports a line of the printer's own software. The printer keeps telling its own phones
what it tells them; the hub adds the wall, the house's log and its "Needs a look".

WORKS WITH THE INTERNET DOWN, once a printer is in. Its name at home spells its LAN address --
192-168-1-73.atlas.home.elyir.app -- so the hub connects to that address straight and checks the
certificate against the name: no DNS, no relay. Finding a printer the first time asks the relay which
printers share the house's public address, which does need the internet; that is a convenience, not a
path anything else depends on.

What the hub may do to a printer is the short list a phone away may do (pause, resume, stop, cool down,
switch spools, "later"), wherever the asker is. The printer would let the hub do more -- it is at home --
but a wall in the kitchen is not somebody standing at the printer, which is what starting a print or
saying the bed is clear needs.
