"""The assistant: it writes and explains, and never runs anything.

Two jobs. Authoring turns a sentence ("when I leave, everything off") into a rule in the vocabulary of
rules.json, saved under "drafts" until a person approves it on the panel; the evaluator never reads
drafts. Explaining answers "why did the hallway light come on" from the event log; the model turns the
log's detail into prose and adds nothing the log does not say. The brain is the only thing that talks
to the model, and the model never sees a token for the driver layer. Design: docs/phase4-intelligence.md.

VOCABULARY = """A rule is one JSON object: {"id", "name", "room", "when", "if", "then"}.
- "name": one plain sentence a person would say about it, no jargon. "id": short kebab-case.
- "room": a room id from the house, "home" for the whole house, "entry" for every room the family comes in through
  (they choose those on the panel; a rule for "entry" runs in each of them), or a LIST of room ids
  ["hallway", "stairway"] when one rule should act on several -- it runs in each. "home" and "entry" never
  go inside a list.
- "when", exactly one trigger:
  {"motion": "on"}                                  any motion sensor in the room (room rules only)
  {"contact": "open"} or {"contact": "closed"}      a door or window sensor in the room (room rules only)
  {"idle": <seconds>}                               no motion in the room for that long (room rules only)
  {"time": "HH:MM"}                                 once a day, 24-hour clock
  {"sun": "set" | "rise", "offset": <seconds>}      sunset or sunrise; a negative offset is before
  {"presence": "nobody" | "somebody", "for": <seconds>}   everyone has left, or someone is back; "for" is optional
  {"intent": "<state>", "in": "<room id or home>"}  a room, or the home, was just set to that state
  {"device": "<device id>", "state": "<state>"}     one named device reached a state (room rules only; last resort)
- "if", optional, all must hold; each is [subject, op, value]:
  ["sun", "below" | "above", <degrees>]             below 0 means after dark
  ["time", "between", ["HH:MM", "HH:MM"]]           may cross midnight; or "below" / "above" one time
  ["weekday", "in", ["mon", "tue", ...]] or ["weekday", "is" | "not", "sat"]
  ["intent", "is" | "not", "<state>"]               this room's current state
  ["home", "is" | "not", "<state>"]                 the whole house's current state
  ["presence", "is", "nobody" | "somebody"]
  ["light", "below" | "above", <lux>]               needs a light sensor in the room
  ["quiet", "above" | "below", <seconds>]          how long THIS room has been still (no motion)
  ["quiet", "<room id>" | ["<id>", ...], "above", <seconds>]   how long those rooms have ALL been still.
      The only way to say "nobody has moved anywhere upstairs for twenty minutes"; a room with no motion
      sensor makes it unknown, and an unknown condition never passes.
  ["device", "<device id>", "is" | "not", "<state>"]
- "then", one outcome, or a LIST of outcomes run in order when the rule should do several things:
  {"intent": "<state>"}                             the normal outcome: the room, or the house, goes to that state
  {"device": "<device id>", "action": "on" | "off" | "lock" | "unlock" | "open" | "close" | "pause" | "play"}
  {"device": "<speaker id>", "action": "sound", "data": {"sound": "<sound id>", "minutes": <optional>}}   a sound on a speaker
  {"device": "<speaker id>", "action": "sound_off"}
  {"notify": "<short text>"}
  {"signal": "way" | "call" | "fill" | "end", "toward": "house" | "out", "rgb": [r, g, b], "device": "<light id>"}
      something SHOWN along the lights in the room for a few seconds, then the lights go back as they were.
      "way" runs from one end to the other ("toward" the house, or out); "call" breathes to get attention;
      "fill" shows how far along ("level": 0-1); "end" lights one end ("end": "house" | "out"). "rgb" is a
      strong color with the others near 0 (an LED shows pastel as white); "device" names one light, else
      every light in the room that can show it. Use it only when somebody asks the lights to SAY something.
States and what they do in a room: occupied = lights on; empty = lights off, media paused; asleep = lights and
media off, doors locked; away = everything off, doors locked; movie = lights low, screen on; guests = lights bright.
A rule says one thing. Exceptions ("everything off except the porch"), several steps, or anything outside this
vocabulary cannot be one rule: then set ok to false and say, in one plain sentence, what you could do instead."""

what will happen in plain words. The person confirms it on the panel before anything moves.
