Controlling the house never needs it: lights, scenes, doors work from the wall for anyone. Changing
the house does: adding devices, renaming, moving rooms, the location, the rules, and the engine's
own sign-in behind the Advanced door. No code set means nothing is locked, which is how a hub
starts; setup offers one, and Home nudges until there is one.
