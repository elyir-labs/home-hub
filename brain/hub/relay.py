"""Two switches, one light: the hub carries the press across.

A two-way switch is two switches wired to one light. In a Brilliant house the wiring is not in the
walls -- the companion switch has no load at all, it is a radio node that reports its own touch, and
something has to hear that and drive the switch the light is actually wired to. The Brilliant console
was that something. When the console goes, every companion in the house becomes a button that does
nothing, so the hub takes the job: a link says "when this one is touched, do the same to that one".

The two ends need not be on the same mesh. The stairway is the case that made this: the companion
sits on the house's own network behind one puck, the load is still on the panel's network behind
another, and the only place the two meet is the broker. So a link is nothing but a rule about topics:

    mesh/<from-net>/<from-addr>/state       ->   mesh/<to-net>/<to-addr>/set
    mesh/<from-net>/<from-addr>/brightness  ->   mesh/<to-net>/<to-addr>/brightness/set

A link says how to listen, and for a companion the answer is NOT its state. Watching a real pair
settled it: a companion announces a press addressed to its partner, while its OWN on/off position
drifts free of the light -- the companion said ON while the load said OFF on the same sweep. So
mirroring a companion's state would drive the light to whatever arbitrary position the companion
happened to be holding. What a companion means is "somebody pressed me", and the honest answer to that
is to TOGGLE the load. The puck says it in plain words, on `press`: whatever a switch's maker calls a
finger is the firmware's to know, not the hub's.

    on: "press"   a press on this switch toggles the load. Two switches, one light.
    on: "state"   the load is made to match this switch. One light following another.

Four things keep it honest, and each one is a bug that was reasoned out before it could happen:

  * a retained message is not a press. Every puck republishes all of its state, retained, on every
    reconnect to the broker. Retained messages only ever set the baseline here; they never act.
  * a message is not a press either -- a CHANGE is. The puck resyncs every switch on link-up and
    again every ten minutes, so the same value arrives over and over. A link fires when the value
    differs from the last one we had, which is also, correctly, how a press made while the hub was
    away still gets carried when it is next heard.
  * what we send comes back. The puck publishes the state of everything it hears, including the
    result of our own command; without a guard a pair of links pointed at each other would volley
    forever. Anything we just sent is ignored on the way back for a few seconds.
  * a command can be dropped. The link is BLE mesh and the answer is the load's own Status, so a
    send is confirmed by the load's state arriving as asked, and retried a couple of times if it
    does not. Below about -80 dBm no amount of retrying helps; that is a job for where the puck sits.

Links live in the data directory, made by hand today (POST /bridge/links). Pairing in the product --
the phone scanning both codes at setup, the extra press on the wall -- writes the same rows.
