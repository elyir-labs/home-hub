"""The house's own address -- jordan.elyir.app -- and the switch that lets it be reached from outside.

The house is complete without any of this. Reaching it away from home goes through the maker's relay,
which is an optional service somebody pays for (docs/service.md), and this module is the hub's half of
that conversation: is a name free, take it, keep the secret it came with, and ask the host to bring the
tunnel up or down. design/address/ is what a household sees; docs/away.md, step 4, is the build.

The secret is the house's whole credential to the relay and the service shows it exactly once, in the
answer to the claim. It is kept in brain-data, beside the passcode's hash, so a backup restored onto new
hardware is still the same house to the relay. It never goes to the panel.

The brain never runs docker. Turning outside on or off is a file the host is watching (away.request),
naming a want from a fixed pair, beside away.env carrying the values; host/away.sh checks every one of
them again before it writes a line of .env -- the same arrangement restart.request has, for the same
reason. Nothing here is on the path of a tap, a light or the panel coming up: with the service down the
house is exactly as it is now.
