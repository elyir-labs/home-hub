# ---- what a thing is, when the house has it wrong (docs/kinds.md) ----

# needs of a device is below; a kind is offered where the device serves exactly that and nothing more,
# which is why a plug may be a lamp (both want an on and an off) and may not be a blind (which wants a
# position) or a thermostat (which wants a temperature). The offer is computed from this table, never
# typed, and that is what stops the panel drawing a brightness slider onto something that cannot dim.
#
# `alarm` is in the on/off group for a different reason from the other three, and it is worth saying:
# a siren reaches this house as a `switch` and there is nothing in HA's domains that says "this one is
# loud". Shown as a plug it gets a plug's tile, which fires on one tap -- and the failure mode of a
# stray finger on a plug is a lamp, while the failure mode of a stray finger on this is a siren at 2am.
# The kind is how a person tells the house which of the two it is holding; everything that asks before
# it acts hangs off it (app/src/twice.ts, and the scenes that step over it in intents.py).
#
# `appliance` is in the same group for the opposite reason from `alarm`: nothing about it needs a second
# tap, but nothing about it should be swept up either. A plug promises to go off when the house empties.
# A fridge's ice maker is a switch entity too, and it must not keep that promise.
