"""Sharing the house outward: what a Matter bridge may publish, and what it is told about each thing.

`docs/matter.md`. The rules live here and not in the bridge, because the bridge publishes the list it
is handed -- so the two decisions of 17 September 2026 are rules with tests rather than a screen's
manners. An alarm is never shared. A lock is shared only where the household has said so, once, with
the sentence beside it.

The other half of this module is identity. A commissioner remembers a bridged thing by its endpoint
number, and matter.js remembers an endpoint number against the id we give it: shift those and Apple
Home shows ghosts. So the id is made here, from the device id, and never from anything that moves.
