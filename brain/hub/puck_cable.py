"""Talk to a bridge puck over its USB cable: the hub's side of puck/src/config.h.

    puck_cable.py <port> upgrade                     new firmware, keeping who it is

`write` is what the hub does when a puck is on its cable (design/puck/Cable.dc.html): every value goes
over hex-encoded, so nothing needs quoting, then `apply` restarts the puck on the new config and this
waits for it to come back and say so. --from reads a desk header (include/secrets*.h) so a puck can be
given exactly what it was compiled with -- which is how this was first proven. Anything given on the
command line wins over the header.

The port is opened with DTR and RTS held low: on macOS pyserial's defaults pulse DTR and reset an
ESP32 on open, and a puck that reboots every time the hub says hello is not one you can talk to.
