"""A fix that reaches a bridge -- or a light strip -- where it is, rather than where the cable is.

A bridge is on a charger behind a sofa, and the only way it used to get new software was somebody
carrying it to the hub. docs/puck-updates.md is the design; this is the hub's half of it. The puck's
half is puck/src/fwupdate.h, and the contract between them is there.

THE TRUST IS THE HUB'S OWN. The image is the one this brain's container carries (releases/bridge/),
and that container was checked against the maker's key before it was allowed to run. So there is no
second signing path for firmware: the key that covers the hub covers what the hub hands a puck. The
puck checks the SHA-256 it was told over the broker, whose credentials only the hub gave it.

WHEN. The bridges take their fixes in the hub's own part of the night, with nobody up, and only in a
house that lets the hub update itself -- a household that turned that off is not overruled for a
puck. ONE AT A TIME: a bad image that strands one puck is a dark corner, and the same image on all
of them is a dead mesh. An offer the puck has not finished with in OFFER_FOR is taken back, and a
version that has come back TRIES times is not offered to that puck again; the puck refuses it too,
on its own count, so the two cannot disagree into a loop.

What the house writes down: a bridge updated, a bridge that went back to what it had, and a bridge
that refused an image because the bytes were not the ones it was told about. Nothing else -- a puck
that was asleep all night is not news.

TWO KINDS, ONE QUEUE. A light strip takes its fixes exactly as a puck does (docs/strip.md, "Updates,
the puck's way"; its half is strip/firmware/main/fwupdate.h), so it is a second Kind here rather than a
copy of this file. Each kind says where its image is, where its offer goes, and what it knows about
each of its devices; everything else -- the window, the tries, the tool -- is shared. And ONE AT A TIME
IS ACROSS THE HOUSE: a strip and a puck dark at once is still two things dark.

A BUILD FROM A WORKING TREE, NOW. On a hub that follows a branch -- a hub being worked on -- a
developer can hand one puck a build straight from their checkout (tools/dev.sh puck) and have it
offered at once rather than at three in the morning. It arrives over ssh, not over HTTP: the tool
parks the image and a request in PUSH, and whoever can do that is already root on this machine, so
it adds no way in that was not there. A hub on releases refuses it, whoever asks. Everything the
puck does with it is unchanged -- hash, trial, rollback, floor -- and the hub writes where it has
got to in PUSH/state.json for the tool to read back.
