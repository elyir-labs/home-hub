"""The roofline: a light outside the house, made of several boxes, that keeps evenings and does holidays.

From a household on 30 September 2026: an addressable strip along their roofline, set every Christmas,
Halloween, Easter and July 4th to colors and effects -- "red and green chasing each other on Christmas"
-- on a Bluetooth controller they are replacing with ours. design/roofline/ drew the three questions
that raised, and the household decided all three on 1 October:

    moves     A WITH C. The occasion owns its motion: Christmas chases red and green, Halloween is
              unsteady like embers, Easter drifts, July 4th twinkles. Nobody ever picks a motion from a
              list; the one control is Hold it still, and strips inside stay still. A look can be SAID in
              the command box -- colors, one of five words of motion, slowly or quickly, read by a fixed
              grammar with no model (hub/commands.py) -- and it plays on the roof before it is kept.
    evenings  B. The roofline keeps evenings of its own, like a porch light: asked once, at the end of
              setting up a light that is outside, "Most rooflines are on from dusk until bedtime. Shall
              this one?" -- Every evening, Only for occasions, Not by itself -- and changeable on its
              pane. An occasion decides only how it LOOKS; dates decide which occasion is showing; and
              an occasion still turns nothing on. The roof turns on because it was asked to keep
              evenings, by the household, once.
    one       C THEN A. Several controllers are ONE Roofline on the wall: one tile, one pane, boxes named
              by where they are, and "Is this more of the Roofline?" at the end of a box's own setup. The
              order of the runs is never asked until a chase is first wanted -- only a chase shows the
              seams -- and then it is asked in the yard: each run lit its own color with a white light
              running the way it goes, tapped in order on a phone, twice to turn one round, pre-filled
              with a guess from the order the boxes were set up.

WHERE A CHASE IS DRAWN. On the boxes, never streamed (the signals rule, docs/strip.md item 50: a Wi-Fi
hiccup mid-chase reads as a broken light). The hub sends each box one description -- colors, motion,
pace, and where each of its runs sits along the whole roof and which way it goes -- and keeps every box
on its own clock (`now`, and `clock/set`). Each box draws its frames as a function of where a light
is along the roof and what time it is, so two boxes agree without ever talking to each other
(strip/firmware/main/look.h). The colors are EMITTER colors, saturated, never the panel's pastels.
