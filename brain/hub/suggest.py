"""Names and rooms for the things that have not been placed yet.

New devices arrive called whatever their maker called them: "TP-LINK Kasa KL125 Bulb", "lumi.sensor_motion.aq2",
"Zooz ZEN32 Scene Controller". The New devices screen should be mostly confirming, so this proposes a plain name
and a room for each one. First the house's own reasoning: a room's name (or one of its usual other names) inside
the device's name or its hardware's name places it; maker and model words come out of the name and a kind word
goes in when nothing else says what it is. Then, when the assistant is connected, one call asks the model about
whatever is still unplaced, with the rooms, the device's neighbors on the same hardware and its kind. The model
only ever proposes; a person taps Use, and the move and rename go through the same guarded routes as by hand.
