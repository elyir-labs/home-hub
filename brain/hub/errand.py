"""Taking a strip through a puck, when the hub cannot hear it.

A hub goes where the Ethernet is and a strip goes where the light is wanted (docs/strip.md item 15).
When the ears table says a puck hears a strip better than the hub does (hub/ears.py), setup runs as
an ERRAND: this hands each protocomm request to that puck over MQTT, the puck writes it to the strip
and hands back what came out (puck/src/errand.h). It is a `Transport` like
strip_door's own, so `strip_door.adopt()` runs unchanged above it -- the SRP6a session is still
opened here and closed at the strip, the puck carries ciphertext it has no key for, and the press is
still checked on the strip (items 38, 39 and 44).

THE WORDS ARE THE PUCK'S, and they are text because this is the only way in: the brain publishes
through Home Assistant's `mqtt.publish` and hears through its websocket, both of which carry
strings. Opaque bytes travel as base64.

    mesh/bridge/<chip>/errand/ask    open <id> <addr> <random|public>
                                     send <id> <n> <ep> <base64>
                                     close <id>
    mesh/bridge/<chip>/errand/tell   open <id> ring|quiet     ok <id> <n> <base64>
                                     fail <id> <n|-> <why>    ring <id>    closed <id> <why>

Answers arrive through the subscription the bridge already holds (`mesh/#`), which hands every
`errand/tell` line to `hub.errand` -- the one errand running, because strips are set up one at a time.
