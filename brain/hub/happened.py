"""What happened while nobody was watching.

The one idea, and everything here follows from it: **a finding is a span, not an event.** "The porch
light has been on for ten hours" is the news. "The porch light turned on at 7:32am" is a row in a log
nobody reads, and it is the only thing the panel could say before this file existed -- the log holds
transitions, and the interesting fact is the distance between two of them, which may be ten hours and
forty rows apart. A timeline cannot show that by construction: you get "turned on, 7:32am" and there
is simply no row for the ten hours that followed.

Ranked the way health.py ranks, and for the same reason. What is STILL true leads and carries the
only buttons on the page, because it is the only part anybody can do anything about. What is OVER
reads quietly under it with no buttons at all: a door that locked itself at 6:40am is not a job, and
offering an act against it would be offering to do something that has already happened.

Two rules carried in from elsewhere, both load-bearing:

- **The brain writes the words, including the headings.** "Still on" is right over two lights and
  wrong over a door that is still unlocked, so this file names the group from what is actually in it
  and the panel draws whatever it is handed. Same reason every word of a health line lives in
  health.py: the panel does not know what it is looking at, so it decides nothing.
- **Nothing is claimed that cannot be known.** A house with no people set up has no idea when anybody
  left, so it does not guess a window -- it says what it has been doing since yesterday and means it.
