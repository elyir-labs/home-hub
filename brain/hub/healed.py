"""The hub starting a part of itself that did not come back, said where a household will see it.

On 26 September the hub was unplugged and carried to the garage, and Messages did not start again with
it: Docker could not restore the container and its restart policy never tried. Every bridge and light
strip sat outside a locked door while the brain went on answering. The host's watchdog now starts a
part like that (driver-layer/host/watchdog.sh), and writes one line to healed.jsonl each time.

This file is the other half, and it exists because docs/restart.md is plain that self-healing must
never be silent: that is how a household runs on a dying card for a year. design/healed/ settled how
it is said, direction C:

- **Once, it is news.** A span on What happened, saying what was cut off and for how long. Nothing on
  Home and nothing on Needs a look, because by the time anybody reads it there is nothing left to do.
- **When it keeps happening, it is a job.** The third time in a week it goes on Needs a look, says
  what the pattern means, and offers the one thing that helps from the wall: a backup.

The host cannot reach the diary, so the line goes through a file. `take()` moves every record into
the event log -- with what was cut off, named NOW, while the house still has those things -- and then
deletes the file. It is called from the two pages that read it, so there is no third timer to keep.
