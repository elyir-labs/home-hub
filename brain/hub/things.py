"""Everything this house has, and what brought each of it.

WHY THERE IS ONE LIST AT ALL. Getting rid of a thing used to mean knowing where it was kept: a
device behind a room's pencil, a puck under This hub, an account on Accounts, a light strip nowhere
whatsoever. Four vocabularies, none of them where a person looks, and three kinds of thing with no
way out (design/forget/Today.dc.html). This is the answer the household picked on 22 September --
one door holding all of it, with the row on a thing's own pane as the shortcut for the thing in
your hand.

AND IT IS GROUPED BY WHAT BROUGHT IT, which is not decoration. What brought a thing is exactly what
decides whether it may leave on its own: an account's integration is allowed to refuse, a puck
re-announces its switches whatever the registry says, and a strip has to be told to let go of us as
well. The panel could not draw that fact because nothing gave it to them. Here it IS the row --
"Goes with Ring", with the door to Ring on the group above -- so nothing has to be explained.

THE PANEL INVENTS NO WORDS HERE. Every line, including the words on the buttons and the question
asked before the irreversible one, is written in this file, the way health.py writes Needs a look.
A panel that composed these sentences would have to know which kinds can leave alone, and that is
the one thing only the brain knows.
