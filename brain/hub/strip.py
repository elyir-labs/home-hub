"""A light strip arriving, and the two questions only a strip has to be asked.

A strip is the first thing this house adopts that is neither a bridge nor already in a wall. It
comes in a box, gets taped behind a television or under a shelf, and is plugged into a socket
nowhere near the hub -- so it is never carried to the cable. It leaves the factory flashed and
knocks over Bluetooth the moment it has power, which is design/strip/ direction A and the shape
design/puck/Knock.dc.html argued for and lost on one line: "it only works on a bridge that already
has firmware on it". A product we ship is flashed. That objection is gone.

The machine is what the panel draws, so what it holds is the sequence a person sees:

    none      nothing to say
    knocking  a strip is advertising and nobody has said it is theirs. Nothing of the house's has
              gone anywhere -- saying it is not yours needs no code, because refusing gives nothing
              away. The identity check is the object: it is lit, and no serial number is shown
    press     our own door, and the only thing it ever asks: press the button on the thing. The
              session is already open and the credentials are still here, because the gate is on
              the STRIP. A tap on "it has no button I can reach" drops a rung, to:
    rhythm    the strip mints four counts of one to six and flashes them, and somebody taps what
              they count. Reached only from `press`, never on its own
    working   `step` is wifi | hub, in that order. Two steps, not the bridge's three: the software
              is already on it, which is the whole reason it could knock
    order     which color comes out first (below). The strip is lit and the household names it
    length    it fills from the plug end and somebody taps when the far end lights
    room      the ordinary room chips every new device gets
    ready     it is an ordinary light from here: the tile, the colors, the schedules, "everything off"
    failed    `text` says why, in words for the wall

Two things a bridge has that a strip does not, and both are absences worth keeping in mind. There
is no mesh, so no keys step. And there is no walk to find it a socket, so the placing instrument --
blinking amber, steady green, breathing red -- has nothing to answer here. That matters for more
than setup: docs/puck-light.md puts a fault ABOVE a puck's light because a puck that glows while its
bridge is down is furniture that lies. A strip is the opposite case. The household is watching a
film, and a strip that turns amber mid-scene because the broker blinked is the product breaking,
not reporting. So a strip keeps whatever the household set it to, and the panel carries the fault.

The radio is behind `Radio` for the same reason bridge.py hides pyserial behind `Cable`: the machine
is tested with a fake one, and nothing in here needs a strip on a desk to run.

# the strip -- and the second run worked, because the device the first run had waited for existed by

# as the strip and the hub failing to talk to each other. It is a line in the band now, and a line
# that arrives a minute late is a line -- so the background loop is no longer the thing that has to
# be fast, and it costs the house's radio less than it did.

# WHAT HAS TO BE FAST IS ADD, and only Add: somebody standing on that page has asked, is waiting,

    THIS USED TO BE OUR OWN BLE PROTOCOL, TWICE, AND BOTH WERE WRONG. First a hand-rolled

    Then WiFiProv, which was at least encrypted but only existed because the Arduino framework
    compiles Matter-over-BLE out. On ESP-IDF it is compiled in, so Matter carries the credentials and
    the commissioning together and neither of ours is needed (docs/strip.md).

        or in whoever's house it was sold into.

        WHAT IS SAID IS NOT RETAINED, so a strip that is unplugged never hears it. The house lets it
        go anyway -- somebody is standing over a thing that is already in a box, and refusing would
        be the panel arguing with them -- and `heard` comes back false so the panel can say the one

        settle that. The strip clears its own retained topics when it hears; this clears them from
        this end for the strip that did not, because a retained `status` outlives the thing it was
