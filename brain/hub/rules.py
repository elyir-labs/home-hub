"""Rules: signals in, room intents out.

A rule is one row in ../rules.json: `when <trigger> [if <conditions>] then <outcome>`. The Engine
turns state changes and the clock into firings, and every firing goes through the same path the
panel uses, logged with source="rule" and enough detail to say why. Deterministic on purpose: the
assistant may draft a rule, a person approves it, this code runs it. Design: docs/phase4-intelligence.md.
