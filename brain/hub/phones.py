"""The phones that belong to the house.

Being on the Wi‑Fi gets a phone nothing on its own once the house has a code. A phone gets in one of
three ways: the person types the code on it; someone at a paired screen taps Allow (and types the code)
after the phone asks; or it is the screen that set the code during setup. Each phone holds a random
token in a cookie; the hub keeps only the hash, so removing a phone deletes the hash and the phone is
out, at once, with nothing on it worth keeping. Phones can be let in for a day or a weekend, and every
one starts home-only: reaching the house from outside is a separate promotion (the relay, when it
exists, checks `remote`). Without a code the house is open on the LAN, as it always was; the join
screen never appears, and setting a code is what turns the door on.
