"""What the lights tell you: a few things worth knowing without looking at a screen.

A SIGNAL IS NOT AN EFFECT, and design/signal/ is the argument. An effect takes the color a household
chose away to show off, and design/occasion/ said no to that. A run of light down a drive toward the
house says something -- somebody is coming in -- and then gives the light back exactly as it was. So a
signal is one of four motions that each MEAN something (px::Signal in strip/firmware/main/pixels.h),
started by something happening, never picked from a menu, and over in seconds.

WHERE THEY COME FROM, direction A with C (picked 24 September):

    the house's own four   someone's arriving, someone's leaving, a door's been left open, something's
                           nearly done. Each is switched on or off on "What the lights tell you", and
                           the house works out when each one is true -- ONCE, here, rather than in a
                           rule per strip that could disagree with the next one.
    a household's own      a routine whose outcome is `{"signal": ...}`, asked for in words and approved
                           in Routines like any other. hub/rules.py runs it; this draws it.

ARRIVING OR LEAVING, which is the hard part of the whole idea and is decided in exactly one place:
somebody's phone coming home is arriving; and in a room the family comes in through (Routines, "where
you come in"), a door or gate that opens with nobody moving by it first is somebody coming IN, while
one that opens after motion by it is somebody going OUT. A room with no motion sensor cannot tell the
two apart, and so decides nothing rather than guessing -- and says so, when somebody tries it.

TRY, on every row, because a signal that never fires is indistinguishable from one that is broken:

    now      plays it once on its lights, even in daylight, and each light says whether it answered --
             the strip on MQTT, with the id of the signal it started (it does not just get asked).
    watch    for WATCH_FOR the house watches for the real thing, with "after dark" set aside, and
             writes down every link of the chain as it happens: the sensor heard, what the house
             decided and why, each light. A chain that breaks says which link, and that link's own
             last word ("last heard 3 days ago"), because "it didn't work" is not a thing anybody can fix.
