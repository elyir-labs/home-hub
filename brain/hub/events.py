"""Append-only event log. The assistant explains from this; nothing executes from it.

Two things arrived on 20 September 2026 and they pull in opposite directions, so the reasoning for
both lives here.

**It is bounded now.** It never was. A hub that had run a year held a year of every motion sensor in
the house in one file, on eMMC, and the file rode every backup. `prune()` keeps each kind for as
long as that kind is worth keeping (`KEEP`) and caps the whole thing at `CAP` rows. What makes that
safe is one rule, and it is the only interesting line in here: for the kinds in `KEEPERS`, **the
newest row for each (kind, subject, new) is never deleted, at any age**. That is exactly the row
`last_by_subject` returns, and two things in the house read it to answer "since when" -- how long a
thing has been offline (health.py) and when a room last saw motion (rules.seed). Without the rule a
prune would quietly reset those clocks and a device that went quiet in March would start claiming it
went quiet today.

`KEEPERS` is a short list rather than every kind, and the reason is `said`: its `new` is the sentence
somebody spoke, so sparing the newest row per value there would keep one row for every distinct
sentence ever said in the house, for good. The rule buys a clock nothing else can reconstruct, so it
is spent only where a clock is actually read.

**It records who.** `source` says what SORT of thing acted (`user`, `device`, `rule`, `hub`,
`system`, `assistant`, `comfort`); `who` says which one -- the name of the phone that asked, or the
wall. It is written for `source="user"` and nothing else. A rule firing has no who; neither does a
background job that a request happened to start, and that second case is the reason the rule exists
rather than being a nicety: a task spawned mid-request inherits the request's context and outlives
it, so attributing its writes to whoever last tapped something would put a name to work they did not
do. In an audit trail a plausible guess is worse than a blank. A house with no code cannot tell its
phones apart at all, so `who` stays null there and the panel says so rather than inventing one.
