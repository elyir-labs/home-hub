"""Turning it off and on again.

Everybody knows the verb and nobody means the same thing by it, so the panel has one door and this
module keeps the ladder behind it. Four rungs, deepest last:

  part        one part of the driver layer          provision.retry_part, offered on Needs a look
  hub         the brain                             this module, and it costs nothing to build
  everything  the whole stack, engine included      the host, through restart.request
  machine     the box                               the host, through restart.request

Rung `hub` is the one a household reaches for most and it needs no privilege at all: the brain
finishes the response, says where it went, and raises SIGTERM on itself. Compose brings it back
(`restart: unless-stopped`) within a second or two. Nothing here runs docker, and nothing here holds
a socket that could -- the same rule updates.py keeps, and for the same reason: it is what stops
anything able to write into the data volume from choosing what runs on the machine.

The two deeper rungs go out the way an update does: a file the host is watching, carrying **a rung
from a fixed set and never a command**. host/restart.sh validates the word again on its side before
it does anything with it.

What comes back up reads restart.json and learns from it. A hub that takes ninety seconds to come
back should say ninety seconds next time rather than the figure that was true on the maker's desk;
that is the whole reason this writes anything down. See docs/restart.md.
