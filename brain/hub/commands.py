"""Plain words into the house's own moves, with no model in the way.

The command box on Home (and, later, a microphone) hands every sentence here first. A fixed grammar over the
house's own names — its rooms, devices, kinds, scenes and sounds — runs at once, the way a tap does: "kitchen
lights off", "movie in the den", "lock the front door", "rain in the bedroom for an hour", "is the garage
closed?". Whatever the grammar cannot place goes to the assistant, which may only propose: an action a person
confirms, or a routine a person approves. So the model is never in the control loop; what runs on its own is
this file, and this file is deterministic. Every sentence is logged, understood or not, so the grammar can grow
from what people actually say. The plan for the microphone is docs/voice.md.
