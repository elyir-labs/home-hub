"""What a strip controller says about itself, and the words the wall says it in.

The strip controller (home-hub-hardware, strip/strip-revA/; docs/strip.md item 51) tells the hub more
than any strip before it. Every ten seconds, and the moment anything changes, it says on
`strip/<chip>/power`, retained: the supply's volts and kind, the board's temperature, and for each
run whether it is on, the kind of supply it was set up on, its amps and ceiling, how far it is
dimmed, its two fault lines, its trips, and the reason it is held dark, if it is.

Until 1 October the hub filed all of that where nothing read it, so a strip could be dark for a good
reason while the wall said it was on. design/controller-panel/, page "held", decided A with B's row:
a strip held dark says so on its tile -- Staying off, and the reason in a few words -- the room gets a
Why?, a tap opens the light's pane with the sentence and the one next step, and Needs a look carries
a row for it to Home. The words are Reasons.dc.html's, one sentence and one next step per reason.

TWO THINGS IT REPORTS ARE NOT FAULTS, and must never be said as one: the board running hot and easing
its ceiling down (never to dark), and a long strip at full white held just under one socket's 5 A.
Both are the household's light behaving. They get one quiet line on the pane and nothing on the tile.

And `starting` -- the second at power-up while the supply reads the same twice -- is never said.

Pure functions, so the words can be held to the board without a broker.
