# Apps: the plan

*Written 12 September 2026, when the question was asked directly: a dedicated app for phone, tablet or desktop?
This is a plan for a decision, not a commitment to build. The decision itself waits on the relay in `docs/away.md`,
and the reason it can wait is the whole of the first section below.*

## The question, and the short answer

One native shell, phones only, after the relay carries its first tap from outside. Not a second panel, not now, and
not a desktop build at all.

Three questions were hiding in the one, and they have different answers:

| | Answer | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Phone** | A thin shell around the panel, later | The web panel already is the app. Four capabilities are native-only and none of them can be used until the relay exists |
| **Tablet** | Already have it; build the kiosk instead | The wall is a tablet in a browser, which is right. What is missing is the thing that makes it *boot into* the panel |
| **Desktop** | No | A wall panel is not a desk. A laptop opens `hub.local` and is finished |

## Rules that do not change

- **The browser path stays complete, forever.** `docs/away.md`'s *Nothing to install* is not softened by this plan. A
  guest with a phone and no app gets the whole house, and anyone who never installs anything loses nothing but the four
  capabilities below, none of which is a way to control the house.
- **There is never a second client.** A shell is a web view onto the panel the hub itself serves, plus native
  capabilities that call the brain's own routes. Not a reimplementation of rooms, the command box or setup.
- **Nothing lives only in the app.** Any feature that exists in the shell and not in the browser makes the house
  smaller for the person who did not install it, which is the opposite of why this box exists.
- **The hub is still what ships.** `install.sh`, a version tag and a container. The shell is a fifth thing that
  versions on somebody else's schedule, and the plan below is shaped mostly by keeping that from mattering.

## Where this starts

The panel in `app/` is a Vue app the brain serves, added to a home screen from the code on the wall, and it already
does everything a phone needs to do: rooms, the command box, adding devices, joining and being let in. `index.html`
carries the home-screen meta, `public/manifest.json` makes it installable and standalone.

Two things are worth knowing before weighing a native app against it.

**There is no service worker.** Nothing in `app/src/` registers one, so what is installed today is an icon and a
full-screen browser — no offline shell, and on iOS web push is not even possible without one. The browser path is not
yet as good as the browser path can be, and some of what an app looks like it would fix is really that.

**The wall panel is not part of this question.** It is a device the hub's owner controls, on plain `http://hub.local`,
and it needs no certificate, no relay and no store. Everything below is about phones, except the kiosk section, which
is about the tablet on the wall being a tablet rather than a browser.

## What a phone shell would actually carry

The list is short, and that is the point. Everything not on it is either already true in a browser or is a satellite's
job in `docs/voice.md`.

| Capability | In the browser today | In a shell |
|---|---|---|
| **Widgets, lock-screen controls, Watch, Siri Shortcuts, CarPlay** | Impossible on iOS. Not "worse" — absent | The whole reason to consider one. *Garage — closed* on a lock screen is the most out-of-the-box thing in this product |
| **Alert-class push** | Web push works from a home-screen icon on a trusted origin, throttled, no critical alerts | Reliable, actionable, background. *Sam's iPhone wants to join* is fine on the web; a door unlocked at 2am is not |
| **Finding the house with no address** | `docs/away.md` already races the LAN against the public name, the way Plex does | Bonjour on the LAN, hub remembered, silent switch. A small improvement on a plan that already works |
| **Trusting the hub's own certificate authority** | A root certificate installed by hand, which fails the promise | Pinned at build time, invisible, no ACME anywhere. See the fork below |

And one that is not a capability: **an app in a store is what a customer looks for when they have bought a box.** Real,
and a reason the shell eventually exists rather than never. Not an engineering reason, and not urgent.

## The fork: the certificate, or the shell

Piece 3 of `docs/away.md` — a real certificate per hub, ACME over DNS-01, a Caddy built with a DNS provider module or
an ACME client in the brain, and the rough edge where a hub offline past a renewal window loses its name — exists
almost entirely **for browsers on phones**:

- The wall runs plain http and does not need it.
- Its microphone does not need it either: the kiosk captures audio natively and the hub recognizes it (settled 14
  September 2026; `docs/voice.md`, *The wall's microphone is the hub's ear*), so no secure context is ever asked for.
- Guests are LAN-only by rule, and the LAN is plain http, so a guest never meets it.
- What is left is a household's own phones, away from home, in a browser — plus web push and the phone microphone.

A shell that pins the hub's CA carries those three payloads and **deletes piece 3 from the hub entirely**. That is a
real simplification of the box: no ACME, no DNS credential minted per house, no renewal to lapse.

What it costs: two store accounts, two signing pipelines, and a review queue sitting between a bug and a house — in a
product whose update story is *one tap, and the code and the container move together*. It also trades a thing anyone
can open for a thing that must be installed first, which is the rule at the top of this file.

**Do not take this fork yet.** Piece 2, the relay, is unavoidable either way and is not started; a shell built before
it has nothing to connect to and no away case to serve. The honest decision point is the first tap from outside.

## Why a web view, and not a native panel

Because of the update story. The hub follows a channel and ships as a tag; an app follows a store. If the shell drew
rooms itself, every hub would have to keep answering a client from any month of the last two years, and a panel change
would land in a house only when Apple got round to it.

A web view has none of that: **the panel comes from the hub, so the UI always matches the hub it is talking to.** Only
the four native capabilities version independently, and each is small and additive enough to be written once and left
alone — a widget that reads `/health` and a room's state, a push registration, a Bonjour lookup, a pinned CA. When the
shell is older than the hub, it shows the newer panel and its widgets keep working. That is the whole design.

## The wall is a tablet, and the kiosk is the gap

Nothing here argues for a tablet app, but there is a real hole next to it. A tablet on the wall today is *a tablet with
a website open*: browser chrome, a screen that sleeps on its own schedule, a swipe that escapes to the home screen, and
nothing that brings it back after a power cut. The difference between that and a thing you hang on a wall is a small
Android kiosk launcher — full screen, screen kept awake, launch on boot, no way out without a gesture nobody finds by
accident.

It is cheaper than either app, it belongs to the out-of-the-box promise rather than to this plan, and it is the one
piece of native code here that is worth writing before the relay exists.

*Built, 13 September 2026: `kiosk/`. A home-screen launcher around a web view of the hub's own panel — full screen,
awake, home button leading back into the house, mDNS discovery for the tablets that cannot resolve `hub.local`, and
one way out in the clock's corner. `kiosk/README.md` has the build and the `dpm set-device-owner` step. One thing it
turned up for `docs/voice.md`: a WebView has no Web Speech API at all, so shape 1's browser microphone cannot run on
the wall as written. Settled 14 September 2026 -- the kiosk will capture audio natively and the hub will recognize it,
which makes shape 2 the wall's voice and leaves shape 1 to phones.*

## Desktop: no

A browser tab covers it completely. An Electron shell would be a third build target, a third signing story and a third
thing to update, serving a case that is already served. Recorded here so the question stops coming back.

## What to do now, either way

None of this is app work. All of it is work the browser path wants regardless, and all of it makes the shell cheaper
if it is ever built.

1. **Finish `docs/away.md` in its stated order** — the per-phone `remote` switch and the gate, then the relay. A shell
   needs every bit of it: pairing, tokens, the away tag, the name.
2. **Add a service worker to `app/`.** An offline shell for the panel, and the prerequisite for web push on iOS. It is
   also the hedge that matters: the better the browser path is, the longer the app stays optional.
3. **Keep the brain's routes the contract.** `/say`, `/phones`, `/health`, the live stream. A shell should need no
   route a browser does not already call, except a push registration.

## Open decisions

- **The fork above** — piece 3's certificate, or a pinned CA in a shell. Decide after the first tap from outside, not
  before. Both can be true: the certificate serves browsers, the shell pins as well, and the hub keeps one path.
- **iOS first, or both at once?** Widgets and the Watch are the reason to build at all, and they are the strongest on
  iOS. Android is where the kiosk launcher is needed. They may not be the same piece of work or the same month.
- **Does the shell ever hold a token of its own,** or is it exactly the phone cookie in `brain/hub/phones.py` in a
  native cookie store? Recommended the latter: one way in, one list under *This hub*, one Remove that works.
- **Who signs it, and under what name** — the same question as who runs the relay and who pays for the VPS in
  `docs/away.md`. It is the selling-a-box question again, not the building-one question.

## Milestones

1. **The kiosk launcher.** Independent of everything else here, and the wall stops being a browser.
2. **A service worker in the panel**, and web push behind it once there is a trusted origin.
3. **The relay running** (`docs/away.md` pieces 2 and 3 up to the name). The first tap from outside is the decision
   point for the fork above; nothing about apps is settled before it.
4. **The shell, if it is still wanted** — a web view, a push registration, a Bonjour lookup, a pinned CA, and one
   widget. If the list grows past that in the planning, it has stopped being a shell and the plan is wrong.
