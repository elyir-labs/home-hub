# Wording: the words on screen, read by somebody who was not here

*Opened 1 October 2026, from a note on the away boards. The switch that lets a phone use the house when
it is not at home was labeled **From outside** — clear to everyone who had spent a month calling it that,
and a riddle to anyone who had not. Outside of what? The yard? The roofline is a light outside. The note
was not about that one label: the panel's headings and descriptions have been written by the people
building it, in the words the building used, and a whole pass is owed.*

## The rule, from now on

**Every label, heading and description is read as a new household member would read it: someone who
did not watch it being made, holding a phone, glancing.** If the meaning depends on knowing how the
thing was built or what it was called in a design note, it is the wrong word.

This binds every change from 1 October 2026 on, whatever else it is about: a new screen, a new board,
a new sentence from the brain. New work does not add to the backlog below while waiting for the pass
to clean it up.

- **Say what the person gets, in the words they would use for it.** "Use this phone when you're away
  from home" rather than "From outside"; "remotely" is closer than "outside", and plainer still is
  saying the situation itself.
- **Our working names are not product words.** Door, let out, the brain, the band, rest, promotion,
  the relay — useful in `design/` and `docs/`, never on the panel unless a stranger would already say
  them that way. This extends AGENTS.md §5's ban on Home Assistant vocabulary to our own.
- **Prose in comments and design notes can stay idiomatic.** This file is about what reaches the
  screen, not how the code talks to itself.
- **A word that is ambiguous in this house is ambiguous everywhere in it.** "Outside" already means
  the yard and the roofline, so it cannot also mean "away from home".
- **The words come from the brain** where they already do (`docs/messages.md`), so a fix there is a
  fix on every screen.

### The words People and phones settled, for every area after it

- A phone that works when you are not at home is set to **Anywhere**; the other answer is **Home only**.
  Never *from outside*, *let out*, *reach the house*.
- The screen on the wall is the **wall screen** when it is named to a person. Never bare *the wall*,
  which also means plaster, and the switches in it.
- **Someone with the passcode** is who can change phones. Never *keeps the house*, *holds the keys*.
- A phone **can use the house**, is **added**, **allowed**, or **removed**. Never *belongs*, *let in*,
  *is out*, *runs it*.
- The house has a **web address**, or a **link**; a phone **switches** to it. Never bare *address*, never
  *move this phone*.
- The phone's own words for its own things: **Home Screen**, not *first screen*.

### What first run settled

- **Say less.** One sentence a lede, and nothing the screen already shows. A screen that has to explain
  itself is a screen to redraw, not a sentence to add.
- **The machinery stays on This hub.** Radios, Matter, the message bus: a row shows outside This hub only
  when it needs the person, and then as a sentence ("Ring needs you to sign in"), never as a status
  ("Running", "Stick on USB").
- **Name a place only by what it says on screen.** The command box is *Tell the house…*; there is no page
  called *Home*. A tip that names a place has to be checked against the panel when the panel changes.
- **Never *the engine*, never *Home Assistant*.** The way to its own settings is *Advanced*. One exception: when a maker's own sign-in page will ask for "your Home Assistant
  address", the panel may say so in brackets, because the person has to *match* the word on somebody
  else's page (AGENTS.md §6's exception for words the house matches rather than writes).

### What adding a thing settled

- **The verb is *add*.** Adding it…, Added., It wasn't added., waiting to be added, Nothing is added until
  you say so. Never *let in*, *join*, *it's in*. (*Join* stays for a phone joining with the passcode,
  which is a person's act, and for a light joining the Wi‑Fi.)
- **The house looks; it does not listen, hear, knock or go quiet.** "Looking for new devices", "3 more
  nearby", "It's lit, so you can see which one".
- **A button says what it does.** *Set up*, not *Have a look*.

### What rooms and devices settled

- **A control says what the device says; a status says it like a person.** The thermostat's modes are
  Heat, Cool, Auto, Off, Fan, Dry, on its tile and its pane, as printed on the thermostat; it is *set to*
  a temperature. But a device that cannot be reached is **Not answering**, everywhere; a speaker has
  *Nothing playing*; a mower is *At its dock*; a camera that is not recording says so.
- **One name for one state.** Not *Not responding* on a tile and *Offline* on a camera; not *Closed* on a
  tile and *Shut* in a pane. `app/tests/roomwords.test.ts` holds the list.
- **A device is removed**, as a phone is. Never *forget*, *take it out of the house*, *is out*.
- **Never *whatever brought it*.** It is *the app or account it came from*.
- **A changed label is measured, not just read.** Two labels in this round wrapped and moved a column;
  a pinned layout test caught one, a screenshot the other.

### What settings settled

- **One name for each thing, on its row and on its page.** The box is **The hub** (never *This hub*, *the
  little computer*). The passcode is **Passcode** (never *Lock the settings*, never *code*): Set a passcode,
  Change it, Remove the passcode.
- **Restarting says how deep:** Quick restart, Full restart, Power off and on.
- **Connections keep their standard names** (Device messages, Zigbee radio, Z-Wave radio, Matter, Ring),
  each with a plain state: Working, Plugged in, Not plugged in, Needs you to sign in.
- **A word means one thing.** *Bridge* is the wall-switch puck, never the sharing link. *Door* is a door;
  a pairing window is "the code works for five minutes"; locks are locks. *The wall* is the wall screen.
- **Who may do something is said by the passcode**, as People settled: "Restarting needs the passcode."
  `app/tests/settingswords.test.ts` holds this area's names.

### What history settled

- **When the house cannot say who, it says *Someone*.** Never *Someone at the wall*; and the hub's own
  watchdog is *The hub*.
- **Nothing raw reaches these pages**: no chip id, no restart's internal name, no row value like "30,80".
  A bridge is named by its room. A connection's own error is the one exception, kept after a full
  sentence because it is the only clue anybody has.
- **"While you were out" only when somebody was**; otherwise "Since yesterday".

### What the band and toasts settled

- **A failure says the hub's sentence, or a plain one.** A reason the hub wrote for a person (a capital,
  a full stop) is shown; anything else -- a developer's guard, a status line, the browser's own words --
  becomes "That didn't work. Try again in a moment.", or "The hub isn't answering right now." A toast
  that names what failed says it once: "Couldn't rename it. Try again in a moment." The rule lives in
  one place, `plainError()` in `app/src/code.ts`, so a hub error written badly next year is still
  caught; write the brain's errors as sentences when a person will read them.
- **Cancelling is never a failure.** "That needs the passcode." is not toasted as an error anywhere.
- **The band leads with its point**, because the wall shows one row of it.

### What strips and the roofline settled

- **The small box a strip plugs into is its *controller*, everywhere** -- indoors and on the roof --
  introduced the first time it appears: "its controller -- the small box the strip plugs into". The
  roofline decision in AGENTS.md section 5 says controllers where it said boxes. What a controller
  drives is a *strip*, never a *run*.
- **A time of day always has its AM or PM**: "off at 11 PM".
- **"Only for occasions"**, one phrasing, wherever evenings are chosen.
- **Volts stay** ("12 V"): it is what is printed on the supply in the person's hand.

## The pass is done -- what is left

Every area in the table above has been through the pass. What remains is the list below: things the
pass found that are not words -- a missing button, a picker a new house never sees -- each needing a
screen change, and so a board of its own, rather than a sentence.

## Known so far, outside the areas done

| Where | Says | Problem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brain/hub/happened.py`, `app/src/ChangesPage.vue` — who did something | "Someone at the wall" | Bare *the wall* |
| `app/src/HubPage.vue`, `brain/hub/api.py` — Restart | "for the screens that keep it. Someone at the wall can do it." | *keep it*, *the wall* |
| `BridgeSheet.vue` | "You can walk away; the wall will say when it is done." | *the wall* as the thing that talks (Strip and Network done) |
| `StripSheet.vue` | "It is being let in now, over Bluetooth" | *let in* for a light being added |

| `SignalsPage.vue` / `brain/hub/signals.py` | "Choose the rooms you come in through, in Routines" | NOT WORDS: Routines only shows that picker once a house already has one -- a dead end for a new house |
| `SignalsPage.vue` | "Ask for it in Routines, in your own words" | NOT WORDS: asking exists only once the assistant is connected |
| `SharePage.vue`, `brain/hub/api.py` | "Running the installer again adds one" | Not something a household can do |
| `brain/hub/health.py` | "Ring needs signing in again." | NOT WORDS: no button on Needs a look, while an account's sign-in has one |

Add to this table whenever a word stops you, rather than fixing it in passing. Each area's pass starts
from this list and then reads every screen and every sentence the brain says in it, since most of what
it will change has not been noticed yet.

## How the pass is done

**The pass is its own piece of work, a full UI/UX pass over every screen, not something folded into
other changes.** There is a lot of this wording across the panel, so expect it to take more than one
session. Split it by area (setup, rooms, people and phones, settings, the band and its messages, the
brain's sentences), and finish one area before starting the next, so that one screen never speaks
two vocabularies.

It changes what the panel says, which is what the panel looks like, so it follows AGENTS.md §1: the
affected screens are drawn with the new words beside the old, the user picks, and tests that pin a
string are updated with the board, not after it.
