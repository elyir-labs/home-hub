# Developing Elyir Home Hub

For the person building, running or changing a hub. The front door is the [README](../README.md); the rules
for a change, and what CI checks, are [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md); coding agents start with
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Installing a hub

Any Linux box with systemd is a hub host: a Raspberry Pi 5, an Intel NUC, a mini PC, a VM under
Proxmox, running Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS or Fedora. One line:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topeysoft/home-hub/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

`install.sh` installs Docker, names the machine `hub` (so it answers at `hub.local`), writes
`driver-layer/.env`, pulls the brain image (CI publishes it for amd64 and arm64; it is built locally
only if the pull fails), and starts everything with Docker Compose. Radio sticks can be plugged in
before or after: `driver-layer/radios.sh` finds them, and a udev rule reruns it whenever one is
plugged in or pulled. Radios on the network (an Ethernet Zigbee coordinator, a PoE Z-Wave dongle)
go in `.env` as `ZIGBEE_NET` / `ZWAVE_NET` and the host needs no USB at all. The brain creates its
own login to the driver layer during the on-screen setup and adds MQTT, Z-Wave and Matter to it by
itself, so there is no token to copy and no Home Assistant UI to visit.

A flashed image rather than an install runs `driver-layer/host/firstboot.sh` once through
`home-hub-firstboot.service`: everything Pi-specific (bootloader, PCIe for an NVMe base, copying
itself from SD to an empty NVMe) happens there, then the install script. That image is built by CI on
every version tag and attached to the release as `home-hub-<tag>-hub.img.xz`: flash it with Raspberry
Pi Imager (*Use custom*), insert, power, wait, open `http://hub.local`. See `driver-layer/host/pi-image/`.
The steps below get a Pi to the same place by hand.

macOS is for developing, not for running the house: Docker Desktop cannot hand USB sticks to
containers, cannot pass multicast (so no mDNS discovery), and needs someone logged in. See
*Developing on the Mac* below.

### Getting a Pi 5 to that point

1. In Raspberry Pi Imager pick Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit). In its settings set the hostname to
   `hub`, your user and SSH key, the timezone, and Wi‑Fi only as a fallback; Ethernet is what a hub wants.
2. Flash the NVMe SSD directly if you have a USB enclosure, otherwise the SD card. A third-party NVMe
   base needs `dtparam=pciex1` in `config.txt` on the boot partition; the official M.2 HAT+ does not.
3. Boot with no SD card inserted to boot from NVMe. If it does not, boot the SD card once, run
   `sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a`, set NVMe first under Advanced Options → Boot Order in `raspi-config`,
   and clone the card to the SSD with `rpi-clone`.
4. `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a && sudo reboot`, then
   the one line above.

Sticks go in the USB 2 ports on a short extension cable; USB 3 and the NVMe are noisy neighbors for
Zigbee in particular. Moving from a Mac that ran the stack: copy `driver-layer/ring-mqtt/` across
first to skip Ring's sign-in, do not copy `driver-layer/homeassistant/`, and stop the Mac's ring-mqtt
container before the Pi's first start so the two do not fight over Ring's token.

## Layout

- `tools/dev.sh` — the first command to run in a clone, and the one to run after a break: what this
  is and what to run, or where you left it, and then the panel on a mock house. Nothing below needs
  to be installed by hand.
- `install.sh` — the one-command install for the hub host. `driver-layer/radios.sh` finds the Zigbee and
  Z-Wave sticks and starts their containers; a udev rule runs it again whenever a stick is plugged in or pulled.
- `driver-layer/` — Docker Compose for the whole hub: Home Assistant Core (headless), Mosquitto,
  Zigbee2MQTT and Z‑Wave JS UI (profiles, on only when a stick is found), python-matter-server,
  the brain, the Matter bridge, and Caddy as the front door (`http://hub.local`, plus `https://` for those who install
  the root certificate).
- `brain/` — Python/FastAPI service on :8300: semantic home model, room-state intent engine, event
  log, websocket stream, first-run setup, device discovery. Talks only to HA's websocket and REST.
  Serves `app/dist`. `brain/Dockerfile` packages it with the panel built in.
- `app/` — Vue PWA for the wall kiosk and phone (`npm run build` → served by the brain).
- `design/` — the artboards: what a screen should look like, drawn at the size of the real display,
  before it is code. One directory per area, each with a `canvas.json` placing every board and the
  note that argues it. `tools/dev.sh design` opens the lot in a browser, on the canvas they were
  drawn on. A UI change starts here — see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md#1-a-screen-is-drawn-before-it-is-built).
- Boards and enclosures — the puck, the wall panel and their studies — live in a separate, private
  repository, [`topeysoft/home-hub-hardware`](https://github.com/topeysoft/home-hub-hardware). Every
  hub clones this one, and no house needs megabytes of board files. Its README says how to view the
  wall boards here through `design/wall`, which this repository ignores.
- `matter-bridge/` — the house as Apple Home, Google Home and Alexa see it: a Matter bridge (matter.js on Node)
  with one endpoint per shared thing, so this house's lights and plugs become Matter devices in those apps. It
  decides nothing — `brain/hub/share.py` hands it the list, and the rules about what may leave the house have tests
  there. Nothing is shared until the panel's switch is thrown (*Share this house*, its own door), and until then it
  announces nothing at all. `docs/matter.md`, `design/share/`, `matter-bridge/README.md`.
- `kiosk/` — the wall's home screen: a small Android launcher that boots into the panel, stays awake and
  full screen, finds the hub over mDNS when `hub.local` will not resolve, and has one way out (the clock's
  corner, held). It draws no house of its own; the panel comes from the hub. `kiosk/README.md`.
- The command box: `POST /say` runs `brain/hub/commands.py`, a fixed grammar over the house's own names (rooms and their
  usual other names, devices, kinds, scenes, sounds) that executes at once and deterministically. What it cannot place
  goes to the assistant, which only proposes. Every sentence is logged as a `said` event, understood or not, so the
  grammar grows from what people actually say. The microphone comes later: `docs/voice.md`.
- New devices: `GET /suggestions` (`brain/hub/suggest.py`) proposes a plain name and a room for each unplaced thing, from
  the words in its name and its hardware first, then from the assistant for whatever is still unplaced. Nothing moves
  until *Use*; that goes through the same guarded move and rename routes as doing it by hand. Telling one row from
  another is two halves that meet in the middle: a press on a wall lights its row (`app/src/pressed.ts`), and
  `POST /devices/{id}/identify` blinks a light, plug or fan three times and restores it, brightness and all, for
  everything nobody can reach. What each row knows besides its name — the account, the model — is `app/src/telling.ts`.
- Phones: once a code is set, every request needs a phone cookie (`brain/hub/phones.py`, `phones.json` in the data
  directory, hashes only). The screen that sets the first code is paired on the spot; a phone types the code
  (`POST /phones/code`) or asks (`POST /phones/ask`, polling `GET /phones/claim/{id}`) and a paired screen allows it
  behind the code (`POST /phones/asks/{id}/allow`, for a day, a weekend or to keep). `GET /phones` lists them, `DELETE`
  removes one at once. Every phone starts home-only; `remote` waits for the relay. The plan: `docs/away.md`.
- The driver layer is pinned. Every image in `driver-layer/docker-compose.yml` names the release this code was tested
  against (Home Assistant 2026.9.1, Zigbee2MQTT 2.14.1, Z-Wave JS UI 11.23.0, Matter server 8.1.2, ring-mqtt 5.9.3).
  Bumping one is a commit, so it rides the hub's own update and a breaking upstream release never reaches a house unread.
- Updates: the brain knows which build it is and checks GitHub's main a few times a day. When it has moved on, Home
  shows *An update is ready*; one tap (behind the settings code) writes `brain-data/update.request`, a systemd path
  unit on the host runs `install.sh` again, and the panel comes back on the new build. `driver-layer/host/update.sh`.
  **An update that does not come back is undone by the hub itself.** Before anything moves, where it was — the commit
  and the image the brain container is actually running — goes into `brain-data/update.prev`; afterwards the brain has
  to answer on `127.0.0.1:8300/alive` and keep answering, or the old commit and the old image go back and the version
  that did it is named in `update.json`. Home then stops offering that version on its own; the button under *This hub*
  still installs it, because a person trying again is a different thing from a hub deciding to. Putting it back needs
  no network, which matters when the thing that broke was the network.
  **A hub that can check what it is installing installs it overnight, on its own**, in the small hours, at a minute
  of its own derived from its id (so ten thousand houses do not move at once) and only once nobody has asked the
  house for anything for half an hour. One switch under *This hub* turns that off and it stays off; a hub with no
  release keys waits to be asked, because updating by itself from something nothing checks is the supply-chain
  problem with the person taken out of it. An automatic install is logged as the hub's doing, not a person's.
  **What changed is on the wall the next morning**, in a house's own words: `releases/<version>.md` is written by
  hand, ships inside the image, and is refused by `tools/release-manifest.py` if it is missing or reads like a
  changelog — no filenames, no containers, no commit subjects, and never Home Assistant. The card opens *This hub*,
  where the current release and every one before it that the build carries are kept.
  **A bad release is stopped without cutting another one**: `tools/channel.py hold v0.3.1` signs a small file that
  hubs check against the same keys, within half an hour and always before they install. The same file lets a release
  out to a fraction of houses first (`tools/channel.py out v0.3.2 0.1`). It can only ever withhold — there is no way
  to say *install this* — and missing, stale or unsigned means nothing is held, because the alternative would let
  anyone who can block a network freeze every hub where it stands. `docs/updates.md`.
- Health: Home has a quiet *Needs a look* list when something is off: a device offline since Tuesday, storage nearly
  full, a driver that wants signing in, an update that did not finish. `GET /health`; the words come from the brain.
  A line that can be acted on carries the way to do it, so none of them sends anyone to Home Assistant: an account whose
  sign-in ran out gets *Sign in again*, which opens the maker's own short form on the same sheet that adds things
  (`brain/hub/onboarding.py` tells the two kinds of open flow apart); something that could not start gets *Try again*.
- Sounds on a speaker: every speaker tile has White, Pink and Brown noise (the brain makes those itself) plus any audio
  file in the hub's sounds folder, with a sleep timer. Recordings in the repo's `sounds/` folder ship in the image and are
  copied into every hub's folder when missing (`tools/add-sound.sh` puts a download there in the right shape, and can push
  it to a hub over ssh at the same time); a household's own files go straight into `driver-layer/brain-data/sounds/` on
  the hub (`brain/sounds/` when running the brain on a Mac) and are never overwritten. `rain.mp3` shows up as *Rain*; MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, FLAC and AAC work,
  and any length works: the brain prepares each file once (ffmpeg is in the image), crossfading its last three seconds into
  its first and repeating it to ten minutes, so the join is seamless and the speaker's own restart comes round rarely. The
  prepared copies live in `sounds/prepared/`; the originals are never touched. The speaker fetches the file from the hub's
  LAN address; the brain restarts it each time it ends, and a rule can put a sound on too (`"then": {"device": "<speaker>", "action": "sound", "data": {"sound": "rain", "minutes": 60}}`).
- Backup and restore: *This hub* on Home hands you one `.tar.gz` with the brain's settings and event log, the engine's
  config, the radios' keys, Ring's sign-in and the front door's certificate authority (not the engine's history
  database or any logs). It carries the house's keys, so it sits behind the settings code. Restoring, here or on a
  new hub's welcome screen, parks the file for `driver-layer/host/restore.sh`, which stops the house, unpacks, and
  starts it again with this hub's own address kept.
- The assistant (routines asked for in plain words, and "why did that happen?") needs a key for the model. Paste it into
  the panel's Routines sheet, or put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` in `driver-layer/.env`. Without one the house runs exactly the same;
  only the asking is missing. The assistant writes drafts a person approves and explains from the log; it cannot touch a device.
- `tools/discover.py` — seeds a device inventory of your own house from a Mac (`docs/inventory.draft.md`, never committed).
- `docs/phase4-intelligence.md` — Phase 4 design: rules as data, the evaluator, holds, presence, the assistant's contract.
- `docs/settings.md` — Settings without a settings page: the four nouns under *This hub* (People, Accounts, Devices, This hub),
  what still forces a visit to Home Assistant's UI, and the order to close each gap so the Advanced door is never a step.
  Its *Where this stands* section is the dated ground truth for how much of that order has actually been built.
- `docs/updates.md` — Updates: what is built (the undo above), and the four pieces after it — a signed release
  manifest and images by digest, the hub updating itself at night, notes written for a house rather than a repository,
  and a hold to stop a bad release spreading. The rules each piece may not break are at the top.
- `docs/away.md` — Away from home: why no VPN and no cloud tunnel, the three pieces (pairing, a relay the maker runs, a
  real certificate per hub), what has landed, and the build and open decisions for the two that have not.
- `docs/voice.md` — The microphone: the shapes considered and what each waits on.
- `docs/matter.md` — Sharing the house outward: why Matter and not three integrations, the bridge that reads the
  brain rather than Home Assistant (so the owner's names and kinds travel), what may and may not be shared, the
  two decisions locks and alarms force, and what Apple, Google and Alexa actually do with an uncertified bridge.
- `docs/kinds.md` — Letting somebody correct a device's kind: why a lamp on a smart plug never hears "kitchen lights
  off", and the two fields that keep the fix from making it untouchable.
- `docs/apps.md` — Phone, tablet and desktop apps: why the panel already is the app, the four things a native
  shell would carry, and the one fork (the hub's certificate, or a pinned one in a shell) to settle after the relay.
- `docs/happened.md` — What happened: why the answer to "should there be a dashboard" is no and what was built
  instead. A finding is a span, not an event ("on for ten hours" is the news, and a timeline cannot show it), so
  what is still true leads with a button each and what is over reads quietly under it. Also the event log's
  retention — it was append-only and unbounded, on eMMC, riding every backup — and the one scoped rule that keeps
  a prune from resetting the clocks `health.py` and `rules.seed` read. And `who` asked, which is only ever written
  for a person.
- `docs/storage.md` — Storage: why the unit sold runs on eMMC and not NVMe (the finding, so it is not re-argued), and
  the plan for the hub to say months ahead that its storage is wearing out: the host reads the wear once a day, the
  brain turns it into one *Needs a look* line with *Back up* beside it, and *This hub* gets a Storage row.
- `docs/shipping.md` — Shipping it: why the unit to sell is a Compute Module 5 and not a Pi 5, the staged hardware path
  (Pi 5 kit, CM5 in a partner box, a custom carrier only later), radios on the network rather than USB, and the list of
  what is open on the Wi‑Fi or missing from the appliance layer before a stranger pays, with what can be done today.
- `docs/service.md` — The relay as a service: why the maker-run relay is the one part of an AGPL project that can be
  charged for honestly, what is sold (a box, a name, the bytes) and what may never be (any capability in the
  software), why the entitlement is checked at the relay and never in the hub, and how billing closed the
  name-squatting question for free.
- `tools/ha_bootstrap.py` — the old manual bootstrap; the brain's setup screen does this now.

## Starting, and starting again

One command, whether the checkout is an hour old or a month old:

```sh
tools/dev.sh          # a fresh clone: what this is, what each directory does, what to run.
                      # a checkout you have worked in: the branch, what is uncommitted, what is
                      # unpushed, what is stashed, what is still listening. Changes nothing.
tools/dev.sh up       # installs both halves, then the panel on the mock house — no hub needed
tools/dev.sh hub      # the same against a real brain, replaced with your code first
tools/dev.sh check    # what CI runs, minus the browser pass
tools/dev.sh free     # let go of a port still held from yesterday — all of them, or free 5173
```

`up` is the one to live in: `npm run dev:mock` with the install step in front of it, so a clone
that has never been built and a checkout from three weeks ago start the same way. It checks the
two floors first (**node 22+, python 3.13+**) and names the version it found, because a `python3`
that is 3.9 — which is what pyenv or conda often puts first on a Mac — builds a venv happily and
then fails in the tests in ways that read as bugs in the code.

It claims :8399 first, the way `hub` claims :8300 — a mock left running from an hour ago, or one
started by whoever else is in this checkout, otherwise ends `up` with a node stack that names
neither. Only a mock of ours is replaced, and it says whose it was; anything else on the port
is reported, and `PORT=8405 tools/dev.sh up` goes around it.

`hub` goes through `brain/dev.py`, which stops whatever hub is holding :8300 and starts yours: a
hub left running from before the break serves an older shape of `/home`, and the panel renders it
without complaint, so it reads as a panel bug.

`free` is the other half of that: the status report names anything still listening — a brain, a
vite, the artboard viewer — and `free` stops it, so `address already in use` does not send you
to an `lsof` and a `kill` aimed by hand. A port a container publishes is reported and left
alone, because that pid is docker's and killing it takes docker's networking rather than the
container.

## Developing on the Mac (until the Pi arrives)

`driver-layer/docker-compose.mac.yml` runs Home Assistant, Mosquitto and Caddy in Docker with no
radios and no host networking (Docker Desktop on macOS cannot do mDNS discovery, so devices are
added by IP or by brand). Run `driver-layer/mqtt-auth.sh` once first: Mosquitto refuses to start
without its password file, and the brain reads the same `.env` to give the engine the password.
The brain runs from its venv (`cd brain && .venv/bin/python main.py`) and
finds HA at `http://localhost:8123`. Panel: `http://localhost:8300/` (or `:8088` through Caddy).

The brain keeps what it learns in `brain/settings.json` (gitignored): the engine login it created,
the owner's and home's names, the location, whether setup finished. Delete the file to run setup
again. `driver-layer/.env` can still carry `HA_URL`/`HA_TOKEN` as a developer override.

Preview any panel state from the address bar: `?setup=1&page=rooms` (a setup screen), `?rest=1`
(the resting clock), `?sheet=add` (the add-a-device sheet), `?at=19:30`, `?wx=rainy`.

### HTTPS

Caddy fronts the brain on plain `http://hub.local` with nothing to install, and on `https://` from
its own local certificate authority. The QR code, the home-screen steps and joining a phone work over plain http; web
push and the browser microphone wait on a trusted https origin. On the LAN today that means installing
`driver-layer/caddy/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt` on the tablet or phone once (iOS
also wants full trust on under Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings), which is fine for the wall
and not something to ask of a phone. The decided way out is a public name per hub with a real certificate, reached
through a relay the maker runs when the phone is away and directly when it is home: `docs/away.md`. No VPN app, no
vendor login.

## Radios and the Advanced door

Nothing here needs a visit. The brain watches the driver layer and adds each part to Home Assistant
itself when it answers: MQTT, the Z-Wave radio (Z-Wave JS UI's settings, including its network
keys, are written once by `radios.sh`), and Matter. The panel's *Behind the scenes* list shows each
part's state; Ring is the one that needs a person, once, to sign in. Plugging a stick in later
starts its container and connects it the same way.

For the curious: Home Assistant on `:8123` is the Advanced door, linked from the bottom of the location
and add sheets, never the product. Zigbee2MQTT's and Z‑Wave JS UI's own consoles (`:8080`, `:8091`) and
the Matter server answer on the hub itself only, not on the Wi‑Fi (`ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 hub.local`
reaches one); they have no sign-in of their own, so nothing on the network gets to pair or unpair a device
past the panel. Messages (Mosquitto, `:1883`) stays on the Wi‑Fi because a bridge on the network needs it,
and takes a password: `driver-layer/mqtt-auth.sh` makes it once into `.env`, writes the broker's password file
and Ring's config from it, compose hands it to Zigbee2MQTT, and the brain gives it to the engine. The host itself gets a watchdog and capped logs from
`driver-layer/host/harden.sh`. What is still open on the Wi‑Fi, and why, is in `docs/shipping.md`.

## Hardware that works

- A Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) with an NVMe base and SSD, or any Intel NUC or mini PC, as the hub host
- Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 (Zigbee and Thread)
- Zooz ZST39 (Z-Wave 800). A 500-series stick such as the Nortek HUSBZB-1 also works for older switches,
  without Long Range
- ratgdo32 for a garage door (Security+ 2.0 only)

## Tests and CI

Every push, on **every branch**, and every pull request runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — a long-lived
branch like `panel-bento` is exactly where a regression has time to settle in unnoticed. It runs: the brain's tests and linter, the
panel's types, linter and unit tests, the built panel driven in a real browser, the shell that runs
on the hub host, and the brain's container image built for both kinds of host (built, not pushed —
so a Dockerfile that no longer works is caught before it reaches the thing `install.sh` pulls).

```sh
cd brain && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q     # the hub
cd app && npm test && npm run e2e                   # the screens, then the screens in a browser
```

`npm run e2e` starts its own mock on :8399, or reuses one already running there. To point it at a
different panel — another branch's build, or a real hub — set `BASE`, and nothing is started locally:

```sh
cd .claude/worktrees/panel-bento/app && npm run build && PORT=8401 npm run mock &
cd app && BASE=http://localhost:8401 npm run e2e
```

Coverage may go up and may not go down: `.github/coverage-check.py` compares each run against
`.github/coverage-floor.json` and fails a change that leaves the codebase less covered than it found
it. There is no target to reach, and the floor is raised by hand in the change that earns it.

Two things are checked that nothing else would notice. `brain/tests/sun-positions.json` holds both
sun implementations — `brain/hub/sun.py` and `app/src/sun.ts`, the same math written twice — to one
table, so the panel's dusk and an after-dark routine cannot drift apart. And `brain/tests/test_shipped.py`
holds `rules.json` and `scenes.json` to what a house that has just been plugged in can actually run:
a starter rule may only name `home` or `entry`, because any other room is one only somebody's
particular house has, and the engine would drop it on every other hub with nothing but a log line.

## Releasing

A version tag is what ships. Nothing else does.

```sh
git tag v0.2.0 && git push --tags
# ...wait for CI to publish the images, then:
tools/release.sh v0.2.0
```

The tag runs the full test suite against the tagged commit and, only if it passes, builds two things: the
brain's container for amd64 and arm64 (tagged `0.2.0`, `0.2` and `latest`, and signed with cosign), and the
flash-and-go Pi image, attached to a GitHub release with its checksum. A tag is not a branch, so branch protection
does not cover one — the test run is what stops a release being cut from a commit that never passed.

**The first one, in order.** `tools/release.sh --check v0.3.0` says which of these is not done yet and
changes nothing, so it is the thing to run between each step:

1. **Make the GHCR package public.** Until the brain image is readable, no release can be signed at all —
   `tools/release-manifest.py` names every image by digest and cannot resolve one it cannot see. It is also what
   stops a hub in a house compiling the brain on its own processor instead of pulling it.
2. **`tools/release.sh --new-key`, then `tools/release.sh --new-key spare`,** in the same sitting. Commit both public
   halves; keep the private halves off this machine's only disk and off GitHub. A hub trusts the keys it was
   installed with and never adds one, so the spare has to exist before the first hub ships or it never can.
3. **Write `releases/0.3.0.md`** — see `releases/README.md`. A release without notes does not ship.
4. **Tag and push**, then wait for CI to publish the images.
5. **`tools/release.sh v0.3.0`**, which signs it and attaches the record.
6. **Watch one hub take it**: it should verify the release, check out the commit the record names, pull by digest,
   come back, and show what is new on the wall the next morning. `driver-layer/brain-data/update.json` says how it
   went and `update.log` says why if it did not.

**`tools/release.sh` is what makes a release installable**, and it is a separate step because it signs with a key
that is not on GitHub. It asks the registries what the tag's images actually are, checks cosign's word that the brain
image was built by this repository's workflow from this tag, writes the commit and every image digest into
`release.json`, signs it, and attaches both to the release. Until it has run, hubs see the release and refuse it —
which is the right way round, and a reason not to leave a tag sitting unsigned. `tools/release.sh --new-key` makes
the keypair; the private half belongs somewhere off GitHub and backed up, because a hub that trusts the public half
will refuse every release the private half did not sign. **Make a spare at the same time**
(`tools/release.sh --new-key spare`): a hub trusts the keys it was installed with and never adds one, so a second key
has to exist before the first hub ships or it can never exist at all. `docs/updates.md`.

Pushes to main publish `main` and `sha-<sha>` images and nothing else. **A merge to main does not
reach anybody's hub.**

Every hub verifies a release before it installs it: `driver-layer/host/verify.sh` checks the maker's signature over
`release.json`, then the hub checks out **the commit the manifest names** rather than the tag (so a moved tag changes
nothing) and pulls every image, ours and the rented ones, **by digest**. The keys it checks against are copied into
`/etc/home-hub/release-keys.d/` on the first install and never added to — the first install trusts the repository, and
every update after it trusts the key. A release that cannot be checked is not installed and is not reported as a
failure: nothing moved, and the panel says so without offering a *Try again* that could not help. The `main` channel
is not verified, deliberately: there are no manifests for commits, a hub following a branch is a hub being worked on,
and an override that skipped the check for releases would only end up pasted into a house.

Every hub follows one of three channels, written into `driver-layer/.env` by `install.sh`:

- **`release`** — the default, and what every hub ships as. Follows version tags. The panel offers an
  update when there is a newer release than the one it is on.
- **`main`** or **`development`** — that branch, commit by commit, for a hub being worked on:
  `HOME_HUB_CHANNEL=development sudo ./install.sh`. The choice sticks: every update after it,
  including the ones the panel installs, follows the same branch. Run it again with
  `HOME_HUB_CHANNEL=release` to put the hub back on releases.

Code and container move together: a hub on `v0.2.0` runs the `0.2.0` image, not whatever is newest.
The panel's *Install the update* tap parks a request file; the host's `update.sh` runs `install.sh`,
which moves the checkout to the newest tag on its channel, pulls the images and restarts.
