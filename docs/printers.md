# Printers: 3D printers in the house

*Written 2 October 2026, when the brain learned to find and follow them. The wall and the phone show them the same
day, from the boards in `design/printers/` (B, with an optional room).*

## The short answer

A 3D printer that runs a printer door (the Astromech door, or anything speaking its small public protocol) is a
thing the house can have, like a light. The hub finds it on the Wi-Fi, asks to be let in, somebody says yes at the
printer, and from then on the house knows what it is doing: printing, done, needs you, stopped.

## Rules that do not change

- **The hub knows printers; a printer never knows the hub.** `brain/hub/printers.py` speaks only the door's public
  protocol and imports nothing of the printer's own software. A printer with no hub loses nothing.
- **A printer lets the house in at the printer.** The hub asks (`POST /door/ask`, `kind: "hub"`, named for the
  house: *Maple Court hub*), and somebody taps Allow on the printer's own screen, or on a phone already paired with
  it at home. Asking only works from the printer's Wi-Fi. There is no code to type.
- **The panel never holds a printer's token.** The token lives in `printers.json` (mode 0600, in the backup); the
  camera and the current thumbnail reach the panel through `/printers/{id}/camera` and `/printers/{id}/thumbnail`.
- **The hub does only what a phone away may do**: pause, resume, stop, cool down, switch spools, "later". The
  printer would let the hub do more, since it is at home, but a wall in the kitchen is not somebody standing at the
  printer, which is what starting a print or saying the bed is clear needs.
- **Works with the internet down, once a printer is in.** A printer's name at home spells its LAN address
  (`192-168-1-73.atlas.home.elyir.app`), so the hub connects to that address directly and checks the certificate
  against the name: no DNS, no relay. Away is the fallback when home does not answer. Finding a printer the first
  time asks the relay which printers share the house's public address (`nearby.elyir.app`); that needs the
  internet, and nothing else depends on it.
- **The printer's words, not ours.** A printer that needs somebody is a line in *Needs a look* carrying its own
  headline ("Atlas needs you") and detail; what it tells its phones goes in the house's log as kind `printer`.

## What the brain does

| | |
|---|---|
| `GET /printers` | `{printers: [view], found: [...], asking: {id: state}}`; also pushed as `{"type": "printers"}` on the stream |
| `POST /printers/look` | ask the relay again, now (the Add door is open), and put last visit's answers away |
| `POST /printers/{id}/add` | ask the printer; the answer arrives on the stream as `asking` and then the printer |
| `DELETE /printers/{id}/add` | stop asking: somebody walked to the wrong printer. The printer's card runs out by itself |
| `POST /printers/{id}/room` | `{room: id \| null}`: the household's choice, from the printer's pane. Never asked when it is added |
| `DELETE /printers/{id}` | off the wall, and the hub off the printer's list of devices |
| `POST /printers/{id}/action` | `{action, args}`, the short list only (403 otherwise) |
| `GET /printers/{id}/camera[?still=1]` | the printer's camera, passed through |
| `GET /printers/{id}/thumbnail` | what it is printing |

A view is `{id, name, connected, via: home|away, state, headline, detail, word, since, room, actions, temps, camera, job}`
with `job = {name, progress, layer, layers, remaining_s, eta_clock, elapsed_s, colors, material, filament, thumbnail}`.
`word` is the state as it fits after a name in a room's line ("Atlas printing", "Vega ready", "Juno stopped"),
`room` is `{id, name}` or null, and `filament` is what the print is made of as the card says it ("White PLA").
The status also carries `asks`: one row per ask, `{id, name, state, title, detail, until}`, in the words the row on
Add says -- "Tap Allow on Atlas's screen" with the time the printer stops asking, then *is in the house*, *said no*,
*Nobody answered on*, or *Couldn't reach*. `allowed` stays in `asking` until the Add door is next opened.

Checked against a real printer on 2 October 2026: found among three, asked as a hub and allowed at the printer,
followed over the Wi-Fi by address, status and temperatures and a camera frame read, a start refused, and removed
from the printer's list when forgotten.

## On the wall and the phone

Chosen 2 October 2026 (`design/printers/`, B with an optional room). **A print leads Your afternoon** the way a show
that is playing does -- printing, waiting for you, or done -- with no buttons on it except while it waits for an
answer, and then only the printer's own two. A printer that stopped with nothing printing is not a card: it is the
band's line and a row on *Needs a look*, and the band never repeats what a card on the same screen is saying. The pane
(`PrinterPane.vue`) is the printer's: room line, how far, temperatures in °C, Pause and Stop print (asked twice), the
live camera, and the hub's limit said once. **A room is optional**, chosen from the pane: a printer with one is a tile
in that room and printing counts as on there; one without lives under *This house, Printers*. Found printers are the
same quiet line in the band and dot on the + door as anything else found, and Add has *Printers on this Wi-Fi*.
The arrangement is pinned by `app/tests/printers.test.ts` and `app/e2e/printers.spec.ts`.

## Not yet

- Notifications from the hub: the printer already tells its own paired phones; when the hub has web push (docs/
  away.md step 6), a printer the house has adopted could tell the house's phones instead. Who sends is then one
  decision, so nobody hears it twice.
