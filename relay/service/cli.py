"""The operator's hands, until payments do this: carry a house, stop carrying it, see who is here.

On the relay box it runs inside the service's own container, against the same file:

    ssh root@<relay> docker exec relay-service python cli.py list
    ssh root@<relay> docker exec relay-service python cli.py grant jordan 2027-10-01 "Jordan, by hand"
    ssh root@<relay> docker exec relay-service python cli.py stop jordan
    ssh root@<relay> docker exec relay-service python cli.py rotate jordan     # a house that lost its key
    ssh root@<relay> docker exec relay-service python cli.py release jordan    # the name goes back

Granting is the only one with a consequence a household would notice the same minute: a house that
was refused at login is carried the next time its frpc retries, which it does on its own.
