"""The address in the name: how a phone on the house's public name reaches the hub directly at home.

A house's public name, jordan.elyir.app, resolves to the relay -- right for a phone away, wrong for one on
the sofa, which would go out to the relay and back for every tap (docs/away.md: the relay is only in the
path when a phone is away). So each house also has a name that spells its own LAN address,
192-168-1-53.jordan.home.elyir.app, and this answers it with that address. It is the shape of Plex's
plex.direct, chosen on 1 October 2026 because NO HOUSE EVER CAUSES A DNS WRITE: Terraform delegates
home.elyir.app here once, and every house's name is worked out from the question rather than stored.

Three rules keep it from being anything else. It answers only for houses the relay carries, so it is
not a general service for pointing names at addresses. It answers only private addresses (10/8,
172.16/12, 192.168/16), so a name under elyir.app can never be aimed at somebody else's public server.
And the certificate for that name is proved over DNS-01 with a TXT record a house can set only for its
own names, with its own secret -- served here, so no house ever holds a Cloudflare credential and there
is still no wildcard certificate anywhere under the zone.
