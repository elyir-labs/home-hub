"""Which houses the relay will carry, and under what name.

A house claims a name -- jordan, for jordan.elyir.app -- and is handed a secret once, in the answer to the
claim. That secret is the house's whole credential: it goes in the hub's frpc.toml, frps passes it here
on every login, and this decides whether to carry the house at all. Only its hash is kept, so the file
this writes could leak without letting anyone dial in as a house.

A secret rather than the signed calls docs/away.md first imagined, and for a reason found by trying it:
frps hands a plugin the client's metadata as frpc read it from its config at start, so nothing a hub
sends at login can be fresh. A signature over a timestamp written once into a file is a bearer token
with extra steps. So it is a bearer token, plainly, carried inside frpc's own TLS.

Being carried needs an entitlement: the relay is an optional paid service (docs/service.md), and a name
costs something, which is also what keeps a thousand of them from being squatted. Until payments exist,
the operator grants entitlements by hand (cli.py), and a name claimed without one is held for a day and
then let go. Nothing here touches DNS: every house is already covered by the zone's one wildcard.
