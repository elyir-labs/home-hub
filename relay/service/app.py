"""The registration service: names for houses, and the relay's yes or no.

Two audiences on one port. Hubs, from anywhere, at https://api.elyir.app: is this name free, take it,
how is it doing, let it go. And frps, on this same box, asking before it carries a house (docs/service.md,
Where the check goes) -- which must never be reachable from outside, because whoever could answer it
could open the relay to anybody. The api name reaches this service the way a house reaches its own
door, through frps and a local Caddy (relay/terraform), so every request from outside arrives with
X-Forwarded-For on it and the plugin route turns away anything that has one.

The house never depends on this. With it down, frps refuses new tunnels and every house carries on at
home exactly as it does now.
