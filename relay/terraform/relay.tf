# The box.
#
# One small server whose entire job is to hold a TCP connection open per house and forward bytes it
# cannot read. It holds no certificate and no key for any house; the pass-through property was
# checked on 12 September 2026 and is a property of *not* configuring a plugin, so the one thing
# never to add to the config below is `plugin = "https2http"`. docs/away.md, piece 2.
#
# Bring your own box by setting `relay_ipv4`: nothing here is made, and the records in dns.tf point
# wherever you say. Running your own relay instead of the maker's is a supported path and always
# will be -- docs/service.md, *Rules that do not change*.

# Two ports and nothing else. 443 is the whole service: frpc dials in on it and phones arrive on it,
# because frps detects the protocol and multiplexes both onto one port (checked against the frp
# documentation, 19 September 2026). That matters more than it sounds -- a hub that could only dial
# out on an odd port would fail in exactly the places away-from-home is for: hotels, offices and
# mobile networks.
#
# A port scan of this box should find a relay that offers nothing to an unrecognized name, and the
# ssh door. Narrow `admin_cidrs` to your own address if it is ever static.
