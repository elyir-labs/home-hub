# The relay routes by the SNI of each handshake and the certificate is proved over TLS, so DNS never
# has to learn a house's name: registering one writes nothing here. That is what keeps this zone
# static, and a zone that never changes at runtime is a zone this directory can own completely.
#
# The wildcard answers for names no house has claimed, which is fine and was checked: an unregistered
# SNI is refused at the relay with `unrecognized_name` and no certificate offered, so a name that
# resolves is not a house that answers.
#
# `proxied = false` is load-bearing, not a preference. Cloudflare's orange cloud terminates TLS at
# Cloudflare, which would put a cloud back between a person and their light switch and quietly undo
# the one property everything else rests on. docs/away.md says so under *Rules that do not change*.

# so asking it over IPv6 finds nothing to connect to and the browser uses IPv4. Checked 2 October 2026: this
