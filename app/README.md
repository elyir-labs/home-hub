# app

The wall panel and the phone view, one progressive web app. Home first, then rooms: the Home
screen says what is on, offers the two house-wide scenes, and shows every camera; a room shows
its scenes and its devices in the product vocabulary. Live over the brain's websocket.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev:mock # everything, watched: the mock brain and Vite together, hot reload, no hub needed
npm run dev      # the same against a real hub on :8300
npm run build    # writes dist/, which the brain serves at http://<host>:8300/
```

`npm run dev:mock` is the one to live in. It starts `mock/brain.mjs` and Vite together and stops them
together, and every change to `src/` is on the screen before you have looked back at it — no build, no
restart. All the preview knobs still work (`?at=19:40`, `?room=kitchen`, `?sheet=hub`, `WX=rainy`,
`LOCKED=1`), and `PORT=8405 npm run dev:mock` moves the mock if something already holds :8399.

Which paths go to the brain rather than to Vite lives in `dev-proxy.ts`. It used to be a hand-kept list
in `vite.config.ts` and it had gone stale — `/health`, `/phones`, `/presence`, `/sounds` and five others
fell through to Vite, which answered them with `index.html`, so those screens worked everywhere except
in the dev server. `tests/dev-proxy.test.ts` now holds the list to every path the panel calls, so it
cannot happen again quietly.

## Tests

```sh
npm test                 # the pure logic: the sun, the words, the colors, the store, the code prompt
npm run test:watch       # the same, as you type
npm run lint             # the linter CI runs
npm run typecheck        # vue-tsc, the same pass `npm run build` makes first
npm run e2e              # the built panel in a real browser against the mock brain
npm run e2e:watch        # the same in Playwright's UI: pick a test, watch it run, step through it
```

`npm run e2e` needs the panel built (`npm run build`) and Chromium once (`npx playwright install
chromium`); it starts `mock/brain.mjs` itself. The specs in `e2e/` assert on behavior rather than
on pictures — that a hold opens a device without also switching it, that a rail card is crisp only
once it is fully in, that the house recedes behind an opened card and comes back exactly as it was,
and that every screen draws, logs nothing, and never scrolls sideways. `*.touch.spec.ts` runs the
same gestures with a finger, because a long-press is also the browser's own gesture and a mouse-only
pass proves less than it looks like.

## Looking at it without a hub

`mock/brain.mjs` is a stand-in brain with a lived-in house of eight rooms: lights at half, a film on the TV, a
thermostat cooling, three cameras, two things found nearby, four routines. `npm run mock` serves the built panel
on http://localhost:8399/ with every preview parameter working; `BRAIN=http://localhost:8399 npm run dev` runs
the dev server against it instead of the real brain. `WX=rainy`, `FOUND=0`, `ENGINE=down`, `LOCKED=1` and
`FRESH=1` change what it says; `ASK=1` (with `LOCKED=1`) has a phone asking to join, and `?join=1` previews the join screen. `npm run shots` (after `npx playwright install chromium`, once) photographs every
screen at kiosk, wall, tablet and phone sizes into `mock/shots/`, which is the quickest way to see a layout
change everywhere it lands.

Kiosk: open http://hub.local/ full-screen on the wall tablet (Add to Home Screen on iOS/Android).
`?room=<id>` opens straight into a room. After three minutes without a touch the panel rests on a
clock over the sky; a touch brings it back to Home.

## First run

Until the brain says setup is done, the panel shows `src/Setup.vue` instead of the house: welcome,
your name and the home's name (which creates the engine login behind the scenes), where home is,
which rooms, what to add, done. Every step after the names can be skipped. `?setup=1&page=rooms`
previews any screen. The same pieces live on after setup: `src/Adding.vue` (the four beats of adding
anything) sits in the *Add to the house* sheet, and `src/SortView.vue` is the *New devices* room
where things that arrived unwatched get a name and a room.

## The sky

Behind everything is a live sky: the sun and moon where they really are, stars, clouds, rain, snow,
fog and lightning, with a landscape the interface sits on. The sun is computed in the app from the
clock and the home's location. Until a location is known the Home screen carries one soft
"Where is home?" card; it opens a sheet that can use the device's own location (only on https or
localhost, where browsers allow it), find the hub's rough position from its internet address, or
search for a town by name, and it also accepts typed coordinates. Saving sends the location to the
brain, which remembers it in `brain/settings.json`, writes it into Home Assistant (so `sun.sun`
becomes correct) and sets up the free Met.no integration if no weather entity exists yet. The
footer of Home shows the current place with a Change link. `HOME_LAT`/`HOME_LON` in
`driver-layer/.env` still work as a headless fallback. Preview any moment with `?at=19:30`, any
condition with `?wx=rainy` (Home Assistant's condition names), the resting screen with `?rest=1`
and the sheet with `?sheet=location`.

## How it is put together

- `src/store.ts` — the one place that knows the house: rooms, live link, scenes and what each one
  will do, optimistic actions with a toast when the house refuses (and an Undo on it when a chip under *On right now*
  turns something off), activity lines and the plain-
  English "Recently" list built from the brain's event log.
- `src/views/HomeView.vue`, `src/views/RoomView.vue` — the two screens.
- `src/SceneBar.vue` — scene buttons; each shows its effect for the room it is in.
- `src/Setup.vue`, `src/Adding.vue`, `src/SortView.vue`, `src/LocationPicker.vue` — first run and
  the few things a person is ever asked: names, code, place, rooms, what is in the house.
- `src/Adding.vue` and `src/prove/` — adding anything, in four beats that never vary: what have you
  got, which one is yours, letting it in, it's in — which room. The shell owns the beats and every
  button on them; the pieces in `prove/` fill the second beat and draw nothing else. Which piece
  depends on the OBJECT, never the protocol: `Blink` (a switch already on the wall announces itself),
  `Press` (a plug or bulb joins a radio — the hub tries each one it has, and never asks which),
  `Code` (a Matter code typed, or a switch's own code read by a phone's camera), `SignIn` (a maker's
  account, and every form their flow asks for), `House` (a bridge or another panel, which arrive by
  themselves). `src/adding.ts` holds the doors, the words and the types; `tests/adding.test.ts`
  pins the vocabulary so no route can quietly grow one of its own. design/adding/.
- `src/code.ts`, `src/CodePrompt.vue`, `src/CodePage.vue` — the code on the settings. Every request
  goes through `request()`, which attaches the code kept for this tab and, when the hub answers 401
  `code`, asks for it and retries. Controls never ask; changes do. `?sheet=code` previews the sheet.
- `src/Join.vue`, `src/Asks.vue` — the phones that belong to the house. When the hub answers 401 `phone`, `request()`
  raises the join screen: give a name, ask, and wait for a screen that is already in to tap Allow on the card
  `Asks.vue` shows under the command box; or type the code. `PeoplePage.vue` lists the phones (`?sheet=people`). Every settings page is a page of one panel, `HousePanel.vue` (`?sheet=house`): the doors down the left, the page on the right.
- `src/tiles/` — one tile per capability. The light tile is the dimmer (tap toggles, drag dims).
  Media shows artwork, transport and volume. Cameras open full screen in `src/Viewer.vue`.
- `src/Viewer.vue`, `src/live.ts` — one camera, full screen. A still comes up at once; behind it the
  viewer tries WebRTC (signaling over `/devices/{id}/webrtc`, video straight from HA's go2rtc), then
  motion JPEG (`/devices/{id}/stream`), and settles for refreshing stills if neither can be had. The
  chip says Live only while a picture is moving; a speaker button turns the sound on when WebRTC brings
  some, and a light button works the lamp built into a floodlight or spotlight cam (`attrs.light` names
  it). Tiles stay stills, so a strip of cameras costs nothing.
- `src/Sky.vue`, `src/sun.ts` — the sky canvas and the solar math behind it.
- `src/panel.css` — the whole look: tokens, the veil over the sky, layouts down to phone width.

Nothing in the app names a Home Assistant entity or shows a setting; that is the Advanced door.
