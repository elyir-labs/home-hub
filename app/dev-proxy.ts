 * Which paths belong to the brain rather than to the panel.

 * In production the brain owns every one of these and serves the panel on whatever is left. The dev
 * server has to reproduce that split, and the list used to be maintained by hand and had gone stale:
 * /health, /phones, /presence, /sounds and five others fell through to Vite, which answered them with
 * index.html, so those screens quietly broke in `npm run dev` and nowhere else. That is the kind of
 * thing that teaches you to stop using the dev server.
 *
 * tests/dev-proxy.test.ts holds this list to every path the panel actually calls, so it cannot rot
 * again without something saying so.
