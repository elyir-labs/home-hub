   Nothing in any house can listen yet -- docs/voice.md left the wall's words to the hub and a
   phone's to a certificate that does not exist -- so the first thing asserted here is the
   DEGRADATION, because it is the one every panel is running today: the orb answers no, and Say.vue
   falls back to the line it has always had. The rest holds the preview honest, since move 6 is
   drawn against it and a move drawn against a lie is drawn wrong. */
