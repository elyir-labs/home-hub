/* The settings' words, pinned to the sheet the household chose on 2 October (design/words-settings/,
   Chosen): one name for each thing. The box is The hub on its row and on its page; the passcode is
   Passcode on both; restarting says how deep, never which part; and the words that had two meanings
   on these pages -- the little computer, the door that opens for five minutes, the bridge that
   carries what is shared -- stay gone. These fail on purpose if a second name grows back. */
