/* Who this screen is, as far as the phones go.

   The house answers /phones with what THIS phone may see, so the panel works out nothing about who is
   allowed what -- it reads the row the hub keeps for it. These hold the two places that still matters
   on this side: the live nudge has to be followed by asking (it no longer carries the roster, because
   one message goes to every panel at once), and the word for what this screen may do comes off `how`. */
