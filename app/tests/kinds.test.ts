/* What a thing IS, when the house has it wrong: docs/kinds.md.

   A lamp on a smart plug is a `switch` to the driver -- and Home Assistant is not wrong, it IS a switch.
   It is also, in the only sense the person living there cares about, a light. On this side that is one
   question: does the panel draw and name the thing by what its owner said, everywhere, and never by the
   raw field the brain picks a service from. */
