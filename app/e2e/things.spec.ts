/* What this house has: the one door, on the glass. design/forget/ThingsDoor.dc.html.
 *
 * The page is nearly all template, so this is where its arrangement is held. Three things have to
 * be true, and each of them is a decision that was made before the code:
 *
 *   - It is grouped by WHAT BROUGHT A THING, and a thing an account brought has no way out of its
 *     own -- it says so on the row, with the door to the account on the group above it.
 *   - Every word on it comes from the brain. The panel draws the acts and invents none of them, so
 *     the question a person reads before an act with no undo is written in one place.
 *   - Nothing goes without being asked, and the asking names the thing.

     page under This house has four to six, and a row button on a real house's worth of rows made
     thirty-four, inside a scroller inside a rounded overflow:hidden panel.

     Headless Chromium does not composite, so it renders this perfectly and can never catch the bug.
