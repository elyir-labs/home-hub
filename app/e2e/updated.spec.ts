/* After an update the hub comes back on a new build, and the page has to come with it: until it
 * reloads, the wall is last week's panel talking to this week's brain, and nothing on the glass says
 * so. What is under test is that the page reloads by itself when the hub answers with a different
 * version, and that the page after the reload still says what happened -- a toast does not survive
 * a reload on its own.
 *
 * The new version is spoken into the page's own stream by the test, as the hub would speak it when
 * it comes back: the mock does not restart, and the real one takes the link down for a minute, which
 * is exactly why the reload rides the version and not the link.
