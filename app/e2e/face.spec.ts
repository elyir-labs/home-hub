/* The face, in the browser that is actually served the panel.

   This file exists because of one specific way a face can be entirely correct in the source and
   absent from the screen. panel.css used to declare `-webkit-backdrop-filter` by hand alongside the
   standard property; the CSS minifier read that pair as "the prefixed one covers every target" and
   emitted only the prefixed one. Chrome 153 removed the -webkit- alias, so every frosted surface in
   the BUILT panel -- the cards, the rail, both panes, the whole of glass -- went flat, while the
   source still plainly said blur and every unit test still passed. Nothing that reads the stylesheet
   can catch that. Only the built panel in a real browser can, which is what this is. */
