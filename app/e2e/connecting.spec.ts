/* A camera whose picture is still on its way -- full screen, and in the sheet a hold opens on Home.
 *
 * The still is instant and a stream is not. `live.ts` gives an attempt WAIT = 12s before giving up on
 * it, and the viewer runs its two ways one after the other, so a camera that is simply off leaves
 * somebody looking at a motionless photograph for up to twenty-four seconds. What is under test is
 * that the screen says so for all of it -- and says something DIFFERENT once the second way begins,
 * because a label that reads the same at second 2 and at second 23 is how a screen that is working
 * comes to look like a screen that is stuck.
 *
 * The waits are faked rather than served: the mock destroys the WebRTC socket at once, so the first
 * way fails immediately and the second can be held open by stalling its stream. That buys the whole
 * progression in a second instead of twenty-four.
