 * 420ms timer set under a bare `install`, advanced by 150 and then left alone, goes off by itself
 * 1.5s later. `pauseAt` is the one that stops time, and it takes the PAGE's clock, not the runner's:
 * the two drift, and it refuses an instant in the past.
 *
 * It goes here, at the end of settling, rather than inside the press. Pausing jumps the clock
 * forward to the instant named, which fires whatever fell due in between -- and that is a real
 * event: a two second jump taken mid-test moved a tile's state out from under a reading the test
 * had already taken. Jumping before anything is measured means whatever lands, lands first, and
 * the test then measures the room it is actually looking at. */
