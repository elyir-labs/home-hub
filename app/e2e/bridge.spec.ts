/* A bridge that went in has to be acknowledged, or it never goes away.
 *
 * What made this a spec: a puck was set up successfully, "It's in." (now "Added.") was read and Done was pressed,
 * and the sheet came back a minute later. Then again. Then again. Closing it only changed the
 * panel's own copy of the state; the brain still had the finished job and answered every poll with
 * it, so the sheet reopened for ever and Done did nothing the hub could hear.
 *
 * The same bug had already been found and fixed for a job that FAILED, and the fix was written as
 * `if (was === 'failed')` -- so success kept it. This asserts the thing that was actually wrong: the
 * dismissal reaches the brain, and the state it then reports is one that draws nothing.
 *
 * Routed rather than driven through the mock's own bridge state, because the suite runs fully
 * parallel against one mock: pinning a bridge globally would drop a full-screen sheet over whatever
 * the other specs were clicking on.
