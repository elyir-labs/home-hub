/* The command box, at rest and opened -- move 7 of the eight in design/nightfall.

   The claim under test is an ORDER, not a set of durations: width leads and the words follow, so
   the box is already the right size by the time there is anything to read in it, and on the way
   back the words go first and the width follows them home. Durations are load-dependent -- a frame
   on this panel runs about 25ms while glass is being painted -- so what is asserted is which of
   the two is ahead of the other, which is the thing that breaks silently when someone shortens a
   delay. Every number here is sampled per frame in the page, because these moves are shorter than
   the time it takes to screenshot them. */
