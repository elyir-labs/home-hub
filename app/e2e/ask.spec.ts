/* A phone at the door.

   The panel has always ranked this above everything else it can tell a person -- App.vue wakes the
   wall for it, and nothing else -- and then drew it as a card in a strip underneath "An update is
   ready". These hold the three things that changed: it is a pane of its own, it looks the same at
   every hour, and it costs the arrangement nothing.

   The house is stubbed rather than started with knobs, because a locked house with a knock in it is
   a different house from the one the rest of the suite drives, and a spec that needs its own mock
   is a spec nobody runs. Only two endpoints move: the status gains `locked`, without which the
   store throws the asks away, and /phones answers with somebody at the door. */

   row Wall was drawn around keeps the height it was drawn with while somebody is at the door.

   Asserted as the mechanism rather than as two measurements of the row, and that is deliberate. A
   before-and-after needs a house with nothing at the door to measure first, `locked` is what
   decides whether the house is asked about phones at ALL, and it also decides whether the band is
   carrying "Lock the settings" -- so the baseline moves for a reason that has nothing to do with
   the knock, and the live stream can push a status in underneath it either way. Out of flow is the
