/* The camera's bottom sheet plays, and what that is allowed to cost.
 *
 * Two properties, and the second is the one with a bill attached. The sheet shows the still at once
 * and then moves -- and while it moves it stops asking the brain for stills, because a JPEG a second
 * from a cloud camera that is already sending video is a call that buys nothing. And nothing is
 * asked of the camera at all until the sheet has been up for SETTLE: the sheet opens on a HOLD, a
 * gesture people make by accident on a wall panel, and an accident must not wake a doorbell.
 *
 * The mock has no video, so the stream is fulfilled here with real JPEG bytes drawn in the page --
 * an <img> will not decode anything less, and `mjpeg()` decides it is playing by watching
 * naturalWidth. WebRTC is tried first and fails on its socket, which is the fallback this exercises.
