/* The band, and the row that no longer moves for it.

   The row is the whole of what Wall buys: 548 of the board's 900, paid for with the greeting, the
   house line and the next-up line. A house with something to attend to used to hand 35px of that
   back, which is the worst of both -- the row got shorter and the urgent thing was no louder for
   it. Everything else in this file follows from taking the band out of the flow, which is only
   possible because a phone at the door is a pane now and a fault list is a page, so nothing left in
   the band is taller than one line.

   Measured in the page rather than across two loads. A before-and-after needs two houses, and the
   thing that decides what is in the band -- whether the house is locked, what the health endpoint
   says -- can be pushed in by the live stream between them. Adding and removing chips in the DOM
   asks the same question of one layout. */
