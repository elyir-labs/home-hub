/* The thermostat card is the dial on the wall.

   art.ts has drawn a thermostat face since the device library was written, and until now no screen
   in the house showed it: `.bento .tile.climate .face-render` and
   `.tiles > .tile.climate[data-size='third'] .face-render` each set display:none, each with a note
   saying a dial did not survive the card it was given. Both were written when the row was shorter
   and when the dial was competing with two step buttons for the same space. The buttons are in the
   pane now, and design/nightfall page 3 has the card measured at both sizes the row produces.

   This is an e2e because the whole question is whether the drawing reaches the screen. Nothing that
   reads the stylesheet can see a rule five thousand lines away turning it off, and nothing that
   reads the source can see it either: `<DeviceArt>` is in ClimateTile's template whether or not any
   pixel of it is ever painted. */
