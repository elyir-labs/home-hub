/* Asking a light to be a color, in the browser that is actually served the panel.

   color.test.ts pins the vocabulary -- what a light is on, what gets sent, which swatch wears the
   ring. None of that can see whether the control is on the screen, whether it is on the screen for
   a bulb that cannot do it, or whether a tap reaches the house. This can.

   The one it exists for most is the last test. Reading, Evening and Night carried a color
   temperature unconditionally, so tapping one on a lamp somebody had set to pink turned it white
   with nothing on the screen having said it would. That is invisible to every other kind of test:
   the preset worked, the service call succeeded, and the lamp was simply the wrong color. */
