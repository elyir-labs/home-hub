/* The weather, opened.
 *
 * The lozenge was scenery and is now the one piece of scenery that answers a finger, so most of
 * what is worth pinning here is about that boundary: that the tap actually lands (the row covers
 * the weather and swallowed it until panel.css raised the pane), that what opens has NO CONTROLS in
 * it, and that the house behind it is not disturbed.
 *
 * The empty row of verbs is the load-bearing assertion. WallView.vue's whole argument for letting
 * scenery be touched is that what opens is a reading — a pane with a power button in it would be
 * the lozenge quietly becoming a card.
