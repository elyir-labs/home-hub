/* The strip-shaped part of a light's pane: one door, where it sits, and what is behind it.
 *
 * This is here because the arrangement drifted and nothing caught it. The two rows a strip added
 * went across the whole rig, under the brightness column as well, and the pane stopped fitting on a
 * wall -- every test passed, because every test asked what the panel DID rather than where it put
 * things. So this one measures: one row, starting where the colors start, below the three, and a
 * pane with nothing to scroll. design/strip/OneDoor.dc.html is the picture it is pinning.
