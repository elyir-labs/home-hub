 * Which door this page reaches the hub through (design/away/, C; docs/away.md).
 *
 * A phone that has moved to the house's own name -- https://maple-court.elyir.app -- loads the app there,
 * from wherever it is. On the sofa, going out to the relay and back for every tap is exactly what the
 * relay is not for, so the app looks for the hub's name at home -- https://192-168-1-53.maple-court.home.elyir.app,
 * which the relay's DNS answers with the hub's LAN address -- and talks to it directly when it answers.
 * Away, that name is a private address nobody can reach, the look fails fast, and everything goes the
 * way the page came: through the relay.
 *
 * Two names are two origins, and a browser keeps a cookie per name, so the phone carries its token itself
 * here -- in this origin's storage, sent as `Authorization: Bearer` and, on a websocket, as a subprotocol so
 * it is never in a URL. A page on hub.local never has a token and never looks: it is already at home.
