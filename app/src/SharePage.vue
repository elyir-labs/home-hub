/*
 * Share this house: what Apple Home, Google Home and Alexa are allowed to see. docs/matter.md.
 *
 * Three things this screen is shaped by, and each is a decision made before it:
 *
 *   - NOTHING IS SHARED UNTIL SOMEBODY SAYS SO. The first switch is off, and while it is off there is
 *     no bridge running at all -- so this page starts as one line and a switch, not as a list of
 *     ecosystems to scroll past.
 *   - THE DOOR IS SHUT. A Matter bridge with an open window and a printed code will join whoever has
 *     the code, so the code is behind a tap, is shown for five minutes, and shuts itself.
 *   - THE LOCK SWITCH IS ITS OWN, WITH THE RISK IN THE SENTENCE BESIDE IT. Matter carries the unlock
 *     with the lock and there is no half to publish, so this is the one place the panel says out loud
 *     what a household is agreeing to.
 *
 * What is NOT here: a list of every device. A kind is what somebody decides about; a hundred rows of
 * lamps is the list this panel keeps refusing to draw.
