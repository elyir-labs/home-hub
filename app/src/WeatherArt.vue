 * The sky, drawn.
 *
 * One illustration, assembled from the same numbers the sky canvas is painted
 * from, so the two can never disagree -- and a new condition needs no new
 * artwork. The numbers live in sky.ts beside the tables the canvas paints from;
 * this file only draws them. Night is not one of the conditions: the house
 * reports the weather and the sun says which light it is in, so the same fifteen
 * conditions each have to hold up twice. design/Weather.dc.html is that sheet,
 * in both lights.
 *
 * It lives apart from any one arrangement because two of them draw it: Rail puts
 * it in the corner beside a greeting, Wall gives it the left third of the screen.
 * How big it is and where it sits are the arrangement's business and are set in
 * CSS; everything about what it depicts is here.

/* A name of its own for this copy's gradient and mask, because there is more than one copy.
   The bar carries a second drawing for a phone and the stylesheet decides which screen shows
   it, so on a wall both are in the document and the hidden one is FIRST -- and a paint server
   is addressed by id across the whole document, so the sky's cloud was asking for a gradient
   inside a `display: none` subtree, which is not reliably referenceable. Chromium's answer is
   to paint nothing: the fluffy cloud simply was not there, on the one screen it is drawn for.
   ArtDefs.vue is the other half of this rule -- materials every drawing shares are mounted
   once and addressed by one name; anything a component brings its own copy of needs its own. */
