/*
 * What happened: the catch-up for somebody who has just walked in.
 *
 * The idea this page exists to carry is that a finding is a SPAN, not an event.
 * "The porch light has been on for ten hours" is the news. The log holds
 * transitions, so that fact is the distance between two rows that may be ten
 * hours and forty rows apart -- which is why a plain timeline could not show it
 * and why this is not one. brain/hub/happened.py does the measuring.
 *
 * This file draws what it is handed and decides nothing, the same way
 * NotesPage.vue does and for the same reason: the panel does not know what it
 * is looking at. That goes for the group HEADINGS too. "Still on" is right over
 * two lights and wrong over a door that is still unlocked, so the brain names
 * the group from what is actually in it and hands the words over.
 *
 * The ranking is the design. What is still true leads and carries the only
 * buttons on the page; what is over reads quietly under it with none, because
 * a door that locked itself at 6:40am is not a job and a button against it
 * would be offering to do something that has already happened.
 *
 * Nothing vanishes under a tap. Turning the porch light off leaves its row
 * exactly where it was, saying what it now says, with the way back in it --
 * the row is the undo. Re-reading the page from the brain would be the obvious
 * thing and is the wrong one: the finding would disappear mid-tap, taking the
 * heading and everything under it up the screen.
 *
 * The saying-so is the store's `done` map and `doneLine`, not a second one kept
 * here. Home already holds a card a person has quieted, in those words ("Off ·
 * just now"), and App.vue already sweeps them at the three moments nobody is
 * looking. A per-page copy would disagree with Home about a light they both
 * show, and would go on saying it after the wall had gone to rest.
