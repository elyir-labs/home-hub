   a motion sensor on one piece of hardware, and this screen used to ask for their room twice with nothing

   Eleven identical rows called "Switch 000a" is the failure this exists to stop. A switch on a wall
   announces itself the moment a human presses it -- that is how the house reads its state at all --
   so the way to tell the rows apart is to go and press one, and the row it belongs to says so.

   In place, never at the top. A row that jumped would move under the finger of somebody already
   reaching for it, and a second tap in the same place would reach a different thing; the room grid
   learned that the hard way. It highlights where it is and scrolls itself into view.

   Nothing here is new machinery: it reads the same event log the why-sheet reads. The only events
   that count are state changes on things in THIS list, recent, and not ones this screen caused --
   a rename or a move makes no state event, so a press is the only thing left.

   The press is a device's (a state is a device's), and the row it lights is the UNIT's: a dimmer and
   the motion sensor on the same piece of hardware are one row, and a press on the switch lights that
   row, motion sensor and all. */
