/*
 * Reached from outside the house, and the house did not open. One sentence, and it is the brain's:
 * a phone this house knows is told it is set to Home only and who can change that, and anyone else is told
 * nothing they could act on, because from out here the way in does not exist (docs/away.md, piece 2).
 *
 * For a phone the house knows it is also a wait, not a dead end (design/away/, NamedC-out): Sam at the
 * airport asks, Jordan picks Anywhere for it on People, and this screen opens by itself -- it asks again
 * every few seconds, and the moment the answer is yes the house loads. Anyone else has nothing to wait for,
 * so nothing is asked again. There is nothing to tap either way.
