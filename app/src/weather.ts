/* What the forecast MEANS, which is where the words are.
 *
 * brain/hub/forecast.py is deliberately dumb: it turns HA's rows into numbers and stops, on the
 * grounds that a sentence belongs to the panel — which already owns the condition words, the clock
 * and the locale, the same way it works out sunrise from the location rather than asking the hub.
 * This is that half.
 *
 * The whole file exists to answer ONE question, and it is worth saying which: not "what will the
 * weather be", but "is there anything coming that changes what somebody does in the next few
 * hours". Those are different questions and only the second is worth a line on a wall. A panel that
 * says "Cloudy from 3 PM" has spent its most valuable line telling somebody about clouds.
 *
 * So a change here means wet weather starting or stopping, and nothing else is a change. When there
 * is none, these return nothing and the caller draws nothing — the line appears when the house has
 * something to say and is absent the rest of the time, which is the only honest way to spend a line
 * that is sometimes worth having.
