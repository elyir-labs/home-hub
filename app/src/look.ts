/*
 * What the house looks like, as one choice instead of four.
 *
 * The Look page used to ask four questions -- an arrangement for Home, where the
 * way around lives, what the panel is made of, and a tone for the cards. Three
 * by two by two by four is forty-eight answers, and nobody outside this repo
 * knows what "Rail, Top, Glass, Pastel" will look like until they have built it
 * by trial. A person who wants the house to look nice should not have to hold a
 * four-dimensional space in their head to get there.
 *
 * So the four split in two, along a line that was already there:
 *
 *   TASTE -- what it is made of, and which way the cards lean. Nobody can answer
 *   this for you, so it stays a question. It is asked once, as three whole
 *   looks, each of which is a place you would actually want to be.
 *
 *   PLACE -- how Home is arranged and where the way around lives. Read the hints
 *   in layout.ts: "reads well on a phone", "made for a wall", "read from across
 *   a room". That was never taste. It is a fact about the screen, and the screen
 *   already knows it, so it stops being a question and becomes placeOf() below.
 *
 * This is the one thing in the panel that is NOT the same on every screen, and
 * that is not a retreat from "the house decides, not the screen" -- it is what
 * that rule meant all along. Two screens disagreeing about their TASTE is a bug:
 * one house, one feel, and LookPage still writes the feel to the hub so it lands
 * everywhere at once. Two screens disagreeing about their ARRANGEMENT is a phone
 * being a phone. The same look, cut to fit what it is being shown on.

 * Three, and the case for each one is that it is somewhere to be rather than a

 * shown live, side by side, at whatever hour you happen to open the page, so any
 * two that can ever look the same are a bad pair no matter how well they read on
 * paper. Cozy -- warm on paper -- was the obvious third and had to go for exactly
 * that reason: `follow` IS warm after sunset, so from dusk to dawn Cozy and Calm
 * were the same picture twice and the page was asking people to choose between
 * two identical things. Pastel cannot collide with either: it holds dL .335 off
 * the sky where the others hold .135, so it is visibly the lighter one at
 * midnight as well as at noon.
 *
 * So: two ends of the light on paper, and the other material. `warm` and `cool`
 * are still there under Customize, which is the honest place for a tone whose
 * whole character is that it ignores the hour.

 * the panel actually is now: the sky moves through it, so the house looks like
 * the hour without anyone setting an hour. The other three keys default to the

 * so a panel from this branch talking to a hub that has not been updated yet
 * sends "feel" and gets back a look with no feel in it. Read only that key and

 * looking at the screen could work out. Hubs update on their own schedule; a
 * panel that is unusable until they do is a panel that is broken.
 *
 * It does not need that key, because a feel IS a face and a tone. Those two have
 * been in the vocabulary for as long as the faces have, so they come back from
 * any hub, and the feel falls out of them. The key stays -- it is what makes a
 * feel survive a future where two of them share a face and a tone -- but nothing
