 * This house: the one door to everything that is not turning something on or
 * off, as one panel. It rises the way an opened device does -- the home recedes
 * behind it -- and inside it is split the way a tablet's settings are: the
 * doors down the left, always in view; the page on the right, the only thing
 * that scrolls. The title and the close never move, and there is no way back
 * to lose, because the list never left.
 *
 * On a phone the same panel is the whole screen: the list first, a page in
 * front of it with a back arrow. One component, one breakpoint (panel.css).
 *
 * The pages were once separate sheets, each a card floating in the middle of
 * a 1440px wall with its own close button that scrolled away with the content.
 * They kept their code; only the frame changed.
