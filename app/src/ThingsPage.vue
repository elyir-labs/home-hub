/*
 * What this house has: one door holding everything the hub knows about, and the
 * place a thing goes when somebody is done with it.
 *
 * Until this, getting rid of something meant knowing where it was kept — a
 * device behind a room's unlabeled pencil, a puck under This hub, an account on
 * Accounts, a light strip nowhere at all. Four vocabularies, none of them where
 * a person looks. design/forget/ drew the three answers and this is the one
 * chosen: the door holds all of it, and the row on a thing's own pane is the
 * shortcut for the thing in your hand.
 *
 * IT IS GROUPED BY WHAT BROUGHT IT, and that is the whole argument. What brought
 * a thing decides whether it may leave alone — an account's integration is
 * allowed to refuse, a puck re-announces its switches whatever the registry
 * says — so the answer IS the row: "Goes with Ring", with the door to Ring on
 * the group above it. Nothing has to be explained because the shape explains it.
 *
 * THE PANEL WRITES NONE OF THE WORDS. Every line, every button and every
 * question comes from brain/hub/things.py, the way Needs a look draws its acts.
 * Which kinds may leave on their own is the one thing only the brain knows.
