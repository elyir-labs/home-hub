/*
 * Outside, opened in place.
 *
 * The pane every card already opens, on a thing that is not a device. The whole
 * argument for it is in one absence: THERE IS NO ROW OF VERBS HERE. Every other
 * pane has one under the name, and the weather has nothing to do — so this is a
 * reading held open, not a control surface.
 *
 * That matters because WallView.vue is explicit that the weather is not in the
 * house: it is scenery, it travels at its own rate, it is deliberately not a
 * card. A tap that opened a control would be the lozenge pretending to be one of
 * the things the house owns. A tap that opens a page of numbers is the sky
 * saying more about itself, and nothing changes underneath it — which is also
 * what keeps the rule that nothing vanishes under a tap.
 *
 * And it is what buys the lozenge back. Everything that wanted a fifth line in a
 * 226px pane — the forecast, the day, inside against outside — is here instead,
 * at a size that is read at arm's length because somebody walked over and
 * touched it. The lozenge stays a glance.
 *
 * Nothing about the chrome is new: .opened, its veil, its four beats and
 * .pane-rig are the same ones Opened.vue uses, which is why this file is short.
 * See design/weather for the board.
