 *
 * `ear.ts`'s opposite number, and deliberately the same shape: the panel asks for a sentence to be
 * said and never asks who says it. `docs/voice.md` settled on 14 September 2026 that the PANEL plays
 * the answer, as audio in the page, from a clip the hub synthesized and hosts on its own LAN address
 * -- the arrangement `sounds.py` already has with a Cast speaker, so *works with the internet down*
 * is inherited rather than argued for again. Not natively in the kiosk (`docs/apps.md`: nothing lives
 * only in the app, and the wall contributes a loudspeaker rather than a feature), and not on the
 * room's speaker, because an answer has to come from where the hand was.
 *
 * The kiosk is already ready for this and was before the plan was written:
 * `kiosk/app/src/main/java/app/elyir/kiosk/Wall.kt:201` sets `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserGesture = false`
 * with the comment *a sound a rule started just plays*. On a phone, the tap that started the sentence
 * is the gesture, so neither needs one.
 *
 * WHEN the house speaks is not decided here. The brain decides it -- the route rule and the sleeping
 * room, in `brain/hub/voice.py` -- and a reply either carries a clip or does not. This file plays what
 * it is handed.
