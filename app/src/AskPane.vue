/*
 * A phone on the Wi-Fi is asking to join, as a pane rather than as a card in a
 * strip.
 *
 * The panel already ranked this above everything else it can tell you and then
 * rendered it as though it had not. App.vue wakes the wall when the asks grow
 * -- it is the ONE event worth turning the screen back on for -- and the card
 * this replaces carried a comment saying it must look the same at every hour,
 * because it is the one place a person hands out keys to the house and
 * recognizing it instantly is the only defense against answering a prompt they
 * should not. Then it sat in a row underneath "An update is ready", in the same
 * shape, on the same ground.
 *
 * A pane is what the panel already uses for something that needs you now: it
 * rises from the bottom, the room dims behind it, and it is unmissable from
 * across a room -- which is the point, since the person holding the phone is
 * standing there waiting. It also costs the layout nothing, because a pane is
 * over the arrangement rather than in it, which is how Wall's row keeps the
 * height it was drawn with.
 *
 * One phone at a time, oldest first. That is not a simplification: this is a
 * decision about one device, and a list of them invites answering the lot with
 * one tap.
 *
 * The way out is `aside`, not `deny`. Putting a knock aside leaves it standing
 * -- the chip in the band carries it and opens this again -- because a person
 * who wants to look at something else first must not have to choose between
 * denying a phone and being stuck. Only the two buttons decide anything.
 *
 * Its color does not follow the sky, and panel.css says why at more length.
 * Everything else here -- the rise, the fall, the room going quiet -- is the
 * pane the face already measured in design/nightfall slice 5.

   was not being said at all. Whichever way it goes, the fall starts on the tap: the decision is made
   here, the toast carries the word, and a question already answered must not be left on a wall for
   somebody else to answer again.

   The ask is dropped locally rather than waiting for the phones event, so this holds even if that
