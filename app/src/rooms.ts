/*
 * The house, ranked: what order the Rooms tab puts the rooms in, and how much
 * of the screen each one gets. Drawn first as design/rooms/Main.dc.html.
 *
 * The tab used to be repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr)) -- every room the
 * same 218x108 box whether it was the room with the television on or the empty
 * bathroom. Measured at 1440x900 the grid came to 1360x226 in a 618px stage, so
 * two thirds of the screen was sky and the busiest room in the house had its
 * line ellipsised at "2 lights on · The Bear · Blind op…".
 *
 * This is the room screen's own grammar one level up -- three heights and
 * nothing else, columns filling down then right -- so the panel has one idea
 * about ranking rather than two. See views/RoomsView.vue for the grid, and
 * RoomCard.vue for what each size is allowed to say.

 * HOW MANY ROOMS STAY CARDS, which is the rule the whole arrangement now turns on.

 * It used to be the other way round: the index took quiet rooms in whole columns
 * of five and whatever would not fit stayed a card. That left the bento ending
 * wherever it happened to end, and tracks() closed the hole by giving the
 * remainder to the last card -- fine when the hole is at the foot of a column,
 * absurd when the last card STARTS one. On a thirteen-room house with one lamp
 * on, a room with "1 light off" to say was drawn a whole column tall.
 * design/rooms/Long.dc.html, and design/rooms/DemoteB.dc.html for this answer.
 *
 * So the BENTO is what ends flush, and the index takes the rest: the smallest
 * number of leading rooms whose cards come to whole columns, which is
 *
 *   at least two, because one room leading and one beside it is the
 *     arrangement, and a lead on its own is not;
 *   at least the number of rooms doing something, because those are never rows;
 *   at most one short of the house, because an index of nothing is not an index.
 *
 * One always exists once there is an index to have: every size is a multiple of
 * five, so three more cards carry the total through every multiple of fifteen,
 * and an index needs five quiet rooms before it exists at all.
 *
 * What it spends is the rule from 17 Sep 2026: the index is no longer whole
 * columns, so its last one can run short. That was chosen knowing it -- a short
 * column at the END of the house reads as the list finishing, where the same
 * hole in the middle of the index read as a bug.
