/*
 * IT BLINKS. Beat two for a switch that is already screwed to a wall.
 *
 * The code on a switch's back is not a password -- what it buys is knowing WHICH switch, and a switch
 * on a wall has its code facing the plasterboard. So it is proved by the switch instead: the house
 * asks what is waiting, makes one announce itself, and a person says whether the blinking one is the
 * one they just touched. THE IDENTITY CHECK IS THE OBJECT, NOT A NUMBER -- which is also why this
 * needs no camera, and runs on the wall exactly as it runs on a phone.
 *
 * It blinks them ONE AT A TIME. A room with two blinking switches in it answers nothing.
 *
 * Draws its middle and nothing else: the title, the buttons and the ending are the shell's.
 * design/adding/Proving.dc.html, and design/puck/Held.dc.html before it.
