/*
 * PRESS IT. Beat two for a thing out of a box: a plug, a bulb, a sensor, a remote.
 *
 * THE RADIO IS NOT THE QUESTION. Somebody holding a plug cannot tell you whether it is Zigbee or
 * Z-Wave, and should never be asked: the hub is the only one in the house that knows, so the hub
 * works it out. It opens each radio it has in turn while this screen is up, and the screen says one
 * thing throughout -- press its button. A device left in pairing mode is caught on the next pass.
 *
 * Matter is the exception and it is not one a person has to understand either: a Matter thing has a
 * code printed on it, and a code is a thing you can SEE. So it is offered as "it came with a QR
 * code", which is a question about the object in their hand, and it hands over to the code piece.
 *
 * Draws its middle and nothing else. design/adding/Proving.dc.html.
