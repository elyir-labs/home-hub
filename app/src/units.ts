 * A unit, and the parts it has.
 *
 * A Brilliant dimmer, a Ring pathlight, a motion switch: one thing on the wall that reaches the hub
 * as two devices, a light and a motion sensor, on one piece of hardware. The brain already treats
 * the hardware as the thing -- moving either part moves the unit -- and this file is the panel's
 * side of the same fact, in the two places a person meets the parts separately:
 *
 *   New devices, where a unit used to be two rows asking for a room twice, and nothing on the screen
 *   said which motion sensor was which switch's. Here it is one row, its parts named under it.
 *
 *   The room, where the switch's own motion sensor is a chip on the reading strip while the switch is
 *   a tile. The brain hands the tile its sensor (`attrs.motion`, the way a floodlight camera is handed
 *   its lamp), so the tile says Motion and the strip does not say it twice.
 *
 * machines.ts groups by the same field for a different reason -- a fridge's features are all of a
 * kind, and want one card -- and the two are kept apart on purpose: a unit is a thing and its sensor,
 * a machine is a thing and its features.
