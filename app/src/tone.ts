 * What color a card is, given what the sky is doing.
 *
 * The rule that matters: a card is never given an absolute color. It is given a
 * distance from the sky — always this much lighter, always this far around the
 * hue wheel. Fixed colors look right at one hour and wrong at another, because
 * the field moves a long way between them: the band behind the cards sits at
 * L 0.15 at midnight and L 0.49 at noon. A card fixed at L 0.30 is a lit surface
 * at night and a hole punched in the daylight by lunchtime. Holding the distance
 * instead means the relationship can never invert.
 *
 * Two things follow from that on their own, and neither is special-cased:
 * cards dim through a storm, because the sky they track has dimmed; and their
 * color strengthens under overcast, because a flat gray sky can carry color
 * that a bright blue one drowns.
 *
 * What does NOT move: the lamp accent, the live green, the danger red. Those are
 * signals — "on", "watching", "unlocked" — and a signal that changes color with
 * the weather is not a signal. They stay exactly as panel.css declares them.

 * built from toneVars that ignore the face. Four different colors to choose

 *
 * THE RULE: a tone leans the PANE, never the SKY. The sky is real -- it tracks
 * the hour and the weather, and every card and every pane in the system holds
 * its distance from ground(). Warming it would make every distance here a lie,
 * and it would be a lie about the weather. The glass is a made object, and what
 * a made object is tinted with is a choice. So --glass-field is untouched below
 * and only the pane moves.
 *
 * `follow` is deliberately NOT in this table. On paper it changes character --
 * pastel by day, warm after dark -- and doing that here would repaint every
 * Nightfall house in the world after sunset tomorrow, which is a change to the
 * default rather than the repair of a dead control. Left out, the pane keeps
 * the sky's own hue exactly as it always has, and nobody's house moves unless
 * they went and asked.
 *
 * Chroma is the number that matters: the pane sits at .012 unleaned, which is
 * near enough neutral, and .045 is the least that reads as a tint rather than
 * as a rendering artifact. Pastel is the one tone that has to move more than
 * its hue -- on paper its whole character is a much lighter card, dL .335
 * against .135 -- so here it is a MILKIER pane rather than merely a bluer one,
 * lifted and carried at a higher solidity.
