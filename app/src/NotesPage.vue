/*
 * Needs a look: the things the house cannot fix by itself.
 *
 * An account whose sign-in has expired, a radio that stopped, a thing that has
 * gone quiet, an update that failed. layout.ts calls this a strand because it
 * carries the only Sign in again a person has -- without it an expired account
 * can only be put right by opening Home Assistant, which is the thing this
 * panel exists not to need.
 *
 * It is a page of JOBS, and that is the whole design. Before, it was a page of
 * true sentences with two buttons on it: six of the nine lines a real house was
 * showing had no way forward at all, and the ninth -- the dead radio that had
 * caused the other six -- read last, as if it were the least of them. Somebody
 * tapped "8 things need a look" and got a report.
 *
 * So the brain now hands over jobs and the panel just draws them (health.py).
 * Two things follow from that, and both live there rather than here:
 *
 *   The cause is the line. A fault carries what went quiet with it in `with`,
 *   so one dead radio is one row and not seven, and the six names sit under it
 *   where a person can see it is their front door and their dimmer. Fixing the
 *   one clears all of them, which is why they are not rows of their own.
 *
 *   Every row carries its own `acts` -- including the WORDS on the buttons.
 *   The panel does not know what it is looking at and so decides nothing here;
 *   a row with nothing to offer is a gap in the brain, not in this file.
 *
 * What this file does own is the asking. Anything that cannot be taken back
 * (removing a thing from the house) goes through the two-tap the rest of the
 * panel uses: the first tap turns the button into the question with the name in
 * it, the second does it. Nothing vanishes under one tap.
