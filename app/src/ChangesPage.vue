/*
 * Who changed what. Reached from What happened, behind the code.
 *
 * What is in it is exactly what lock.needs_code() gates: if a route needed the
 * code to do the thing, the record of it having been done belongs on the same
 * side of the door. Turning a light on is not a change to the house and is not
 * here, which is also what keeps this short enough to be read rather than
 * scrolled past.
 *
 * Every sentence is the brain's (brain/hub/happened.py, class Changes). The one
 * thing this file is careful about is the WHO, and the care is all in what it
 * does not do: `named` says whether the house actually knew, and where it did
 * not the row says "Someone at the wall" rather than picking the likeliest
 * person. A plausible guess in an audit trail is worse than a blank, because a
 * blank cannot be believed by mistake.
 *
 * The card at the foot is the same rule as the memory card in docs/storage.md.
 * Before the code was set the house had no phones to tell apart, so nothing
 * before that date can name anybody -- and saying so once is more honest than a
 * column that is mysteriously empty for the first half of the list.
 *
 * The other line at the foot says when there is more behind this page. A list
 * that simply stops at its limit looks like a list that ended, and on the one
 * page whose whole job is completeness that is the worst thing it could imply.
 *
 * It is PAGED, and that is a fix as much as a nicety. Drawn in full, a real
 * house's year of changes came to 5331px of rows -- three to five times taller
 * than any other page in This house, and all of it inside the panel's
 * backdrop-filter. On that page, and only that page, scrolling left rows drawn
 * as bare icons with no text beside them: the element boxes painted and the
 * text and SVG did not. No page in this panel should be thousands of pixels
 * long, and an audit read newest-first has no reason to be.
 *
 * Paging narrowed that and did not close it: asking for older ones a few times
 * walks the page straight back past the height where it happens, which is
 * around eight thousand pixels. What closes it is in panel.css, on
 * `.happened-over li` -- the rows off screen are not drawn until they come near
 * -- and the reason is written there. Thirty at a time stays, for the reason it
 * was chosen: it is what somebody reads in one go.
