 * THE SHELL. It owns the four beats and every button on them, and it knows nothing about radios.
 *
 * 1 choose   what have you got -- four doors, and whatever is already waiting
 * 2 prove    which one is yours -- one of the pieces in prove/, which draws its middle and nothing else
 * 3 working  letting it in -- one bar, one sentence, one honest how-long
 * 4 in       it's in, which room -- the same ending for every route
 *
 * A piece never draws a title, a button or a progress bar of its own: it says what it needs from the
 * person, and hands back `working`, `caught` or `wrong`. Which is why every route ends up saying the
 * same words -- there is only one place left that says them. design/adding/Shell.dc.html.
 *
 * The piece STAYS MOUNTED through beat three, hidden, because it is the thing doing the work and
 * unmounting it would cancel what it is waiting on.
