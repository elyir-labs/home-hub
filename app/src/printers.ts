 * Where a 3D printer lives on the wall, as rules rather than as a component. design/printers/, chosen
 * 2 October 2026: B, with an optional room.
 *
 * A PRINT LEADS YOUR AFTERNOON, the way a show that is playing leads it. A card for every print, not for
 * every printer: one appears when a print starts and stays while it is printing, waiting for somebody, or
 * done, and goes when the printer is Ready again -- at a moment nobody is watching, through the same `done`
 * map every other card on Home keeps its place by. A printer that stopped with nothing on its bed is not a
 * card: it is a job, so it is the band's line and a row on Needs a look, which the brain already sends.
 *
 * A ROOM IS THE HOUSEHOLD'S CHOICE, never a setup question. A printer with one is a tile in it, and printing
 * counts as on for that room's place on Rooms; a ready one does not. A printer with none lives under This
 * house, Printers. The card above is the same either way.
 *
 * Everything here is a function of the brain's view and nothing else, so the arrangement can be pinned by
 * a test that fails if it drifts (app/tests/printers.test.ts). The words are the printer's own or the
 * brain's; what this file adds is the frame -- which card, in which state, in which order -- and the
 * numbers said as a household says them.
