/*
 * One bridge, looked at on purpose.
 *
 * Until this existed a puck surfaced on the panel only when something was WRONG with it -- a note
 * when it went quiet, a line on This hub when it was a version behind -- so the only place a
 * household could act on one was a problem report. That is the wrong shape for an object that
 * mostly just works, and it is what left the nightlight's "lift on motion" reachable nowhere but
 * Home Assistant, which product-direction-out-of-the-box forbids. docs/puck-light.md, step 5.
 *
 * Three brightnesses rather than a slider, because this panel has no sliders: brightness everywhere
 * else in the house is a gesture on the thing itself, and the nightlight IS a light in the house --
 * so anybody who wants a level between these has its own tile to do it on. What belongs here is the
 * handful of decisions that are about the BRIDGE, and they are all named in words.
