/* Where a spoken sentence comes from -- and nothing whatever about what it means.
 *
 * `docs/voice.md` settled on 14 September 2026 that the wall's words are recognized on the hub
 * (shape 2) and that a phone browser's own recognizer is shape 1, behind the certificate in
 * `docs/away.md`. Neither exists yet, so `canListen()` is false in every house and the orb keeps
 * the only job it has ever had: a tap opens the box to type in. That is the degradation the gesture
 * was chosen for -- there is no control to hide, and no second path through `Say.vue` for the
 * panels that cannot listen.
 *
 * What this file is for today is the SHAPE, so move 6 can be drawn against something. Two sources
 * will sit behind it when they exist, and neither of them draws anything: `getUserMedia` in a
 * browser that has it, and the kiosk's bridge on the wall, where a WebView has no secure context to
 * ask from. The panel asks for a sentence back; it never asks who heard it.

 * on the device*, which is still an open decision in that file.
 *
 * It needs no certificate on your own machine: `http://localhost` is a secure context already, and
 * so is `127.0.0.1`. A phone pointed at this Mac over the LAN is not one, and that is the only case
