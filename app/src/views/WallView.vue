/*
 * Home as a wall: the weather given the left third of the screen, and what is
 * on beside it.
 *
 * The difference from Rail is what is NOT here. There is no greeting, no house
 * line and no next-up line, because on a panel read from across a room the top
 * of the screen is the most valuable space there is and a sentence you have
 * already read costs it. The date moves into the top bar, which was carrying it
 * anyway, and everything that is left is either the sky or something you can
 * touch. That is the whole arrangement: it is drawn in
 * design/nightfall/Main.dc.html, a 1440x900 board where the row starts 180px
 * down instead of two thirds of the way.
 *
 * The weather is not a card. The sky's drawing goes straight onto the field and
 * one lozenge of glass hangs in front of it, which is what makes the left third
 * read as depth rather than as an empty tile -- a card there would be a box
 * saying what the whole screen behind it is already saying.
 *
 * It does OPEN, though, and that is not a contradiction of the line above. What
 * it opens is WeatherPane.vue, which is the only pane in the panel with no
 * controls in it -- there is nothing to do to the weather. So the lozenge is
 * still not a card: a card is a thing you operate, and this is a reading that
 * has more to say than four lines. Everything that kept wanting a fifth line in
 * here went there instead, which is what lets this stay a glance.
 *
 * Everything else is shared: the same row, the same tiles, the same drawing of
 * the sky. <Attention /> comes first and unchanged -- see layout.ts for why
 * that is not a per-layout decision, and it is the one thing here the board
 * does not show, because the board has nothing to attend to.
