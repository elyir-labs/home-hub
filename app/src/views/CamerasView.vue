/*
 * The Cameras tab of the Top navigation: every camera in the house, each a tap
 * to watch and a hold to open.
 *
 * The frame is the Rooms tab's, for the Rooms tab's reason: the stage does not
 * scroll, the head stays where it is, and what does not fit runs off to the
 * RIGHT. This used to be a grid that wrapped DOWNWARDS inside a scrolling
 * stage, and because a camera tile is `.tile.wide` -- two columns of the grid
 * the room screen used to use -- only one of them fitted on a row. Three
 * cameras made a 1483px column inside a 618px stage: the heading scrolled away
 * and the last camera was cut off behind the command box.
 *
 * Rows are counted here rather than in CSS because only the browser knows how
 * many frames fit across: one row while they all fit, two once they do not, and
 * the rest of the house off to the right. A row is then capped at 4:3 of the
 * frame's own width. Without the cap a house with three cameras would stretch
 * three frames down the whole stage and `object-fit: cover` would crop each
 * 16:9 view to portrait -- throwing away two thirds of the scene the camera was
 * put up to watch, which is a strange way to fill a screen.
