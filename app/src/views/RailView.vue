/*
 * Home as a rail: what is on now in one row you sweep through, instead of a
 * column you scroll. Made for a wall, where the whole screen is in view at once
 * and reaching the bottom of a page means walking to it.
 *
 * It shows the same devices as the Stack layout and uses the same tile
 * components, so dimming a light or pausing a film behaves identically — only
 * the arrangement differs. <Attention /> comes first and unchanged: see
 * layout.ts for why that is not a per-layout decision.
 *
 * What this file is, then, is where the row SITS: under a greeting, with the
 * weather in the corner beside it. The row itself is BentoRow, which Wall uses
 * too and which knows nothing about either arrangement.
