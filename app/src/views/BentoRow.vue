 *
 * It lives apart from any one arrangement because two of them use it. Rail puts
 * it under a greeting with the weather in the corner; Wall gives the weather the
 * left third and lets the row have the rest of the screen. Neither of those is a
 * fact about the row, and a row that had to be told which one it was in would be
 * a row that could disagree with itself in two places.
 *
 * The row is composed, not just listed. As drawn: what is playing first and
 * tall; then the two glance cards -- a camera and the thermostat -- stacked in
 * one column; then the lit things; then the evening's two scenes as a card of
 * their own; then whatever is left. A row of equal boxes is a spreadsheet, and
 * the difference between that and a room is the one small column.
