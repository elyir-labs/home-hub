/*
 * The Rooms tab: the whole house at once, ranked. design/rooms/Main.dc.html.
 *
 * It used to be `<RoomGrid>` -- every room the same box, in the order the brain
 * returned them, in the top third of the screen. The grid is still what the
 * three home layouts use, where it is one band among several; here it is the
 * whole stage, and the whole stage is what it should fill.
 *
 * The arrangement is the room screen's: three heights, columns filling down and
 * then running off to the RIGHT. What goes over the right edge is therefore
 * always the quiet end of the house -- ranking decides what is hidden, rather
 * than whatever happened to land below a fold.
 *
 * Since 17 Sep 2026 there is a fourth height and rather less going over that
 * edge. A room with nothing on is a ROW, not a card, so the quiet end of a big
 * house is an index you scan instead of a wall of empty rectangles -- a
 * thirteen-room house now lands inside the screen with margin to spare, where
 * before it hid three rooms past the right-hand side. rooms.ts decides which a
 * room gets; nothing here has to know.
