 * How much room a tile gets, and it is three heights and nothing else.

 * A room does not scroll DOWN -- it fills in columns and runs off to the RIGHT
 * when there is more of it than fits. That is what keeps the way back on the
 * screen: not a sticky rule somebody can break later, but the fact that the
 * only axis that moves is one the head does not sit on. The cost of it is this
 * table: tile height is set by the screen rather than by the content, so every
 * tile has to be a full column, a half or a third, for ever. See design/room.
 *
 * Size is how much the tile has to SAY, which is the ranking made visible. A
 * media tile that is playing carries artwork, a title and transport. The lamp
 * actually lighting the room carries a drawing and a dimmer. A thing that is
 * off has one thing to say and that is its name.
 *
 * The numbers are row tracks, not pixels: a column is THREE slots whatever the
 * screen is, so the same three sizes hold at 800 and at 1080. Three and not six
 * because a column has to come out flush -- with six, a half beside a third
 * filled five sixths of one and left the room ragged along the bottom. Three
 * slots can only be filled exactly: one card, or a big and a small, or three

 * it or taken away, and never merely because something in it was switched on.

 * walk up to it. The tiles themselves stay live -- only their size and their
