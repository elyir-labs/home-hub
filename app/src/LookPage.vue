/*
 * How the house looks: one question, three answers.
 *
 * The house decides, not the screen. Pick one here and every panel in the place
 * changes at once, and a screen plugged in next year is already right — so this
 * saves to the hub rather than to the browser. That is also why there is no
 * "apply to this screen only": two screens in one house disagreeing about what
 * they look like is a bug, not a feature.
 *
 * What is NOT a disagreement is a phone laying the same look out as a column
 * while the wall lays it out as a row. That was three of the four questions this
 * page used to ask, and the screen has always known the answer better than the
 * person tapping — look.ts has the argument. So the page asks the one thing
 * nobody can answer for you, and says plainly underneath what it worked out on
 * its own, because a panel that quietly rearranges itself is worse than one that
 * asks.
 *
 * Nothing was taken away. Customize still holds all four, still writes them to
 * the house, and a house that set its look by hand before feels existed opens
 * this page already showing them. It is a disclosure, not a downgrade.
