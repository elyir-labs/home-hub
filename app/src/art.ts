 * What a device looks like, in one place.
 *
 * The same argument as the weather illustration in sky.ts, applied to the things
 * in the house: the tiles draw these marks and design/Devices.dc.html is drawn
 * from the same numbers, so the sheet and the panel cannot drift apart. Add a
 * kind here and both learn it at once.
 *
 * Rung two of *When there is no artwork*. The ladder there is unchanged and this
 * is only its second step: a device that brings its own picture (a camera frame,
 * album art) still wins, and anything with no drawing here still falls through to
 * the icon, oversized and faint. Most houses will mostly see that last rung, so
 * nothing in this file is allowed to make it look like a hole.
 *
 * THE RULE, and it is the only one that matters: what a device is MADE OF takes
 * the ambient; what it EMITS does not. A white shade goes cool at midday and
 * creamy at dusk, because that is what a white thing in a room does. Mix the
 * light it throws the same way and a lamp turns blue at noon -- and a tile that
 * has stopped looking warm has stopped meaning "on". Emitted light sits with the
 * lamp accent, the live green and the danger red: signals, and a signal that
 * changes color is not a signal.
