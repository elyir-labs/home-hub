 * The bar along the bottom, under the Top navigation: the command box on the
 * left, and the household on the right -- who the house knows, and who is in.
 * Real presence from the brain, not decoration: a person keeps their color and
 * their initial but goes quiet when they are out. The last circle is always the + that adds
 * one more, as drawn, so a house with nobody set up still shows where people
 * go. The box is always there, because telling the house things is what Home
 * is for (layout.ts).
 *
 * room: the room the panel is showing, so "lights off" said here means that
 * room, the same as the box inside a room would.
