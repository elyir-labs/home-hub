   was -- in the lamp color, the house's attention color and not a danger color, because the strip is
   being looked after rather than broken. And a tap cannot honor a light that cannot come on, so on this

     Not a wash over it: the same card toneVars builds, at the same distance from
     the sky and the same chroma, turned to a different place on the wheel. That
     matters because --card-light IS the card on the glass face -- the rule there
     is `background-image: var(--glass-sweep), var(--card-light, ...)`, so a lit
     light is not a frosted pane at all, it is the tone's warm card with the
     sweep laid over it. Leave that alone and a pink bulb sits on an amber card,
     which is the two-things-at-once this is here to stop. Replace it with a wash
     over --card-plain, as the first pass did, and the card stops being a card:
     at noon that came out as the milky pink rectangle this replaced.

     Built from --card-l and --card-c, which toneVars already publishes, so the
     lightness and the chroma stay whatever the hour and the tone say they are
     and only the hue is the bulb's. The card still lightens through the morning
     with every other card, and --card-ink still flips at the right moment,
     because none of the numbers that decide those has moved. */

       rgba()) while the bar across the foot uses `--lamp`. Setting only one
       leaves a pink lamp with an amber wash behind it, which is the two-things-
       at-once this is meant to stop.

       And these two are the WHOLE of it. The first pass also repainted the card
       itself, by handing --card-light a wash over --card-plain -- which on the
       glass face quietly swapped the frosted pane for a plain card, so a lit
       Hue came out as a milky pink rectangle with the drawing barely in it. The
       board never did that: its card is the pane, unchanged, and the color
       arrives as LIGHT in it -- the cone out of the fitting, the pool it lands
       in, the dimmer's own wash, the bar and the badge. */

       every lamp was, and is the last thing on this card still saying a color
       the bulb is not. Same two answers, at the bulb's hue: the lit card's own
