/*
 * One machine, its features as rows: a fridge with its ice maker, its Ice Bites and its power cool
 * on one card rather than as three plugs in a row. machines.ts says which devices make a machine.
 *
 * Each row is its own switch and its own way in: a tap flips the feature, a hold opens it, and the
 * card itself is nothing but the frame around them -- it has no state of its own to be on or off,
 * because "the fridge is on" is not a thing anybody at a wall panel needs telling. A row that is on
 * wears the lamp color the way a lit tile does, so what is running reads from across the room.
 *
 * The card is a plain tile in the grid's eyes (`data-size`, the same body grid), so it packs the
 * column the way any other third or half does.
