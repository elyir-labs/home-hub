 * Accounts: every service the house has signed into, and the two things a person
 * can do about one — finish a sign-in it is waiting on, or be done with it.
 *
 * There is no list of names here deciding what an account is. The brain answers
 * with whatever brought something into the house or wants something from a
 * person, which keeps the weather and the clock off a page about accounts, and
 * keeps the driver layer's plumbing off it too: the brain set that up itself and
 * nobody ever signed into it (docs/settings.md, Accounts).
 *
 * Removing one is the end of everything it brought, so the row says how much
 * that is before it asks, and asks twice.
