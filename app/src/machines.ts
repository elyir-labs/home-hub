/*
 * A machine, and the features it has.
 *
 * A fridge reaches the hub as four switches -- its ice maker, its Ice Bites, its power cool, its
 * power freeze -- each a device of its own, each a tile of its own, each named after the fridge.
 * That is a row of four plugs, and it is not what is standing in the kitchen. What is standing there
 * is one machine, and this file says which devices are one machine so the room can draw it as one.
 *
 * The rule is the hardware's, not the name's: the driver already says which entities belong to which
 * unit (`hw`), and the brain passes on what the unit is called (`hw_name`). Two or more appliance
 * features on one unit are a machine. One on its own stays a tile -- a dishwasher with a single
 * delay-start switch is a tile that says Dishwasher, and a card of one row would say less.
 *
 * Generic on purpose. A dishwasher, a washer, a dryer and an oven all arrive the same way, and a card
 * that knew what a fridge was would be a card that did not know what a dryer was. docs/kinds.md.
