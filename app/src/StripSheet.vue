 * words as BridgeSheet: "That's the one" is the identity check here exactly as it is there and under
 * Add (design/adding/Words.dc.html). design/strip/Spine.dc.html is mostly a demonstration that a
 * strip needs no new flow at all -- four of its six beats are this sheet, unchanged.
 *
 * The two that are new are both here because NOTHING CAN BE READ BACK OFF A STRIP. The data line is
 * write-only on every one of these parts, so which order its colors come out in and how far it goes
 * are not detectable. Both are shown on the thing itself and named by the person looking at it, which
 * is the same move as pressing a switch to say which room it is in.
 *
 * The one thing this screen must never do is decide. Whether a strip is offering itself, which half
 * of the color question is live, and what the answers add up to are all the brain's (hub/strip.py);
 * the panel draws the state it is given and sends back what somebody said they could see.
