/* Usually this page is for adding. It is also where a conversation the house already has open is
   picked up; the panel takes that on the way in and hands it here, so the page reads as being about
   that one job.

   ONE SURFACE PER CONVERSATION, NOTHING UNDER IT. While something is being added, this page draws
   nothing else at all -- no lede, no footnote. A half-asked question with the hub's health listed
   underneath it is a page talking over itself, and it is what this page used to do. The health
   itself moved to the hub's own page, where a person goes to ask about the hub rather than about a
   lamp. design/adding/Under.dc.html and design/adding/ChooseA.dc.html. */
