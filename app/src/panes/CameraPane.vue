/*
 * The only kind whose instrument is not a control: the picture is what you came for, so the picture
 * is the pane. The panel has always fetched this still — the old pane drew an outline of a camera
 * instead and made you press Watch before it would show you anything.
 *
 * And now it moves. The still is what comes up first, because it is instant and a stream is not, and
 * a moment later the live picture fades in over it -- the viewer's own two ways, WebRTC then motion
 * JPEG, in a smaller frame. What kept streams off this screen was that a wall of cards each holding
 * one open is how a Pi falls over; a sheet is one camera, and only while it is open, so that
 * argument never reached here. What did reach here was the still's own age: once the chip is honest
 * enough to say a cloud camera's picture is four hours old, the next question is why you are being
 * shown it at all.
 *
 * The sheet opens on a hold, including one nobody meant, so nothing is asked of the camera until it
 * has been up for SETTLE -- and the moment it closes, the session goes with it.
 *
 * When it last saw something is along the foot of the pane with every other kind's day, rather than
 * twice: the hub keeps no picture of a sighting, so a second row here would only have repeated the
 * same four times under four empty frames.
