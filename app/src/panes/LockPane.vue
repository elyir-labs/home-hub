 * The one control in the house that is not a tap.
 *
 * Everything else here opens on a touch, and that is right for a lamp. A front door is different:
 * a sleeve brushing a wall panel must never unlock it, and somebody standing in front of it must
 * be able to see that it did not. So the track is carried the whole way or nothing happens, and
 * what was on the screen stays exactly where it was.
 *
 * The old pane offered this door a power button, which sent act(id, 'on') — an action the brain
 * has no entry for, so the house answered 400 and threw an error across the screen.

   narrows it to the elements it already applied to, and these names can no longer collide with

   What stayed in panel.css, deliberately: anything on the component's outermost element, because
   that is where the rest of the sheet does its cross-cutting work and scoping would make a moved
   rule outrank the ones it used to tie with; any class another component also draws, which is
   shared vocabulary rather than ours; and any rule reaching in from a container (`.bento`,
   `.wall-stage`), which belongs to the arrangement rather than to this. */
