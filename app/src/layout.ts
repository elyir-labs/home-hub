 *
 *   - the command box, so the house can be told things
 *   - anything asking to be let in, which is the only way a new phone joins
 *   - the nudges, which is where an update, a found device or an unlocked
 *     settings code gets offered
 *   - "Needs a look", which carries the only Sign in again a person has
 *
 * A layout that drops one of those strands somebody: no way to approve a phone
 * except from a phone already paired, or no way to re-authenticate an expired
 * account without opening Home Assistant. Arrange them differently by all means.

/*
 * What the panel is MADE OF, as opposed to what is on it or how it is arranged.
 * Paper is what the house has always been: cards with a tone, laid on the sky.
 * Glass is the same house behind frosted panes -- see design/nightfall.
 *
 * A face decides material and motion and nothing else. It does not get to move
 * a card, rename a room or hide a strand: the things Home must always carry are
 * listed at the top of this file and they are not negotiable per-face either.
 * Nor does a face get an absolute palette. Like a tone, it is specified as a
 * distance from the sky, so it holds at every hour -- tone.ts says why.
 *
 * What it DOES get is every surface. That is a deliberate widening, and it is
 * written down here for the same reason Wall's two constants are: a rule that
 * quietly grows is worse than one that says what it now covers.
 *
 * Glass reached the cards, the panes, the lozenge and the orb, and stopped. The
 * result was a screen made of two materials -- glass where a card was, paper
 * everywhere else -- because nobody was sure a face was allowed to touch a tab
 * bar, a chip, or the inside of This house. It is: re-materializing a control
 * is not moving one. The tabs stay where they are, in the same order, reaching
 * the same three screens; what changes is what they are made of and how they
 * answer a finger. A face that may only dress a card is not a face, it is a
 * card style, and the board it was drawn from has no such seam in it.
 *
 * The line that has not moved is the one above: a face may not move, rename,
 * hide or add a control. If a change cannot be made by swapping material and
 * motion alone, it belongs to the layout or to the panel, not here.
