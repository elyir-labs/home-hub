 * Setting up a bridge, on the wall.
 *
 * AN ARRIVAL, WHICH IS WHY IT IS A SHEET. Something you went looking for belongs on the Add page;
 * something that just happened in the room comes up over whatever you were doing, because it is
 * news. Both wear the same four beats and, more to the point, the same words: "That's the one" is
 * the identity check here exactly as it is under Add, and there is no OK button and no Cancel.
 * design/adding/Words.dc.html.
 *
 * One sheet for the whole job because it IS one job, and the person is standing there for all of it.
 * It opens itself: a bridge knocking or being written to is something that happened in the room, not
 * somewhere you navigate to. Drawn from design/puck/ -- Knock (it arrives over the air), Cable (it
 * arrives on the hub's lead), Placing (the walk to find it a socket).
 *
 * The one thing this screen must never do is decide. Whether a bridge is offering itself, how far it
 * has got, and how many switches it can hear are all the brain's to say; the panel draws the state
 * it is given and sends back the two answers a person can give -- yes that is mine, and leave it here.

 * "Leave its light on?" is asked between tapping "Leave it here" and the brain being told -- because
 * the answer travels WITH that message (docs/puck-light.md), and because this is the one moment
 * somebody is standing in front of the thing in the place it is going to live. It is not a state of
 * the brain's machine and must not become one: nothing has been decided about the bridge here, the
 * job is still `placing`, and walking away leaves it exactly where it was, to come back on the next
 * poll. That is also the answer to "what if they never answer" -- nothing is lost. */
