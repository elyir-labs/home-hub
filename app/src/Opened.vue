/*
 * One device, opened in place.
 *
 * The home does not get covered, it recedes: scaled back, blurred and dimmed,
 * so the panel reads as something in front of the house rather than a new page.
 * The timings are measured, not invented — 320ms for the home to fall back,
 * 380ms for the panel to rise, and the content comes up behind it in four beats.
 *
 * Those are paper's. Glass has a measured set of its own, and a room that dims
 * rather than blurring — all of it in panel.css under [data-face='glass'], none
 * of it here, because a face gets to change how a thing moves and not what it
 * is. The one exception is `closing` below, which exists because CSS cannot see
 * the difference between a pane that has not risen yet and one on its way out.
 *
 * The field takes the device's own color while it is open: a warm lamp pushes
 * the whole room amber, a camera cools it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PANE IS, since it used to be one layout for everything. Six slots,
 * and only the fifth changes from a lamp to a mower:
 *
 *   1  where and what      the room, then the name -- and under it, quietly, what
 *                          the house is showing this as when its owner has
 *                          disagreed with the driver (docs/kinds.md)
 *   2  what you can do     the kind's real verbs -- never a blanket power
 *                          button, which for a lock, a blind, a camera and a
 *                          mower was an action the brain refuses with a 400
 *   3  what it says        one reading, large
 *   4  why it is like that one line, then the facts this thing actually knows
 *   5  the instrument      the control a tile is too small for. This is the
 *                          half of the pane that used to hold a 260px
 *                          watermark of the device's own icon and nothing else
 *   6  what it did today   /events, narrowed to this one device
 *
 * See design/device for the boards all of that was drawn on.
