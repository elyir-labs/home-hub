"""Coverage may go up. It may not go down.

There is no target to reach and nothing to game: the only rule is that a change does not leave the
codebase less covered than it found it. Reads coverage.xml (the brain) and coverage-summary.json
(the panel), compares against .github/coverage-floor.json, and says what to do when it has risen.

Usage: coverage-check.py brain brain/coverage.xml
       coverage-check.py panel app/coverage/coverage-summary.json
