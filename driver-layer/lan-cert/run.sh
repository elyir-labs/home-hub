# The certificate for the house's name at home -- 192-168-1-53.<house>.home.elyir.app -- kept current.
#
# Runs inside the stock lego image (docker-compose.yml, lan-cert), so there is no ACME code of ours. The
# challenge is DNS-01, because a LAN address is the one place a CA's validator can never reach; lego's
# `httpreq` provider hands the TXT record to the registration service with the house's own name and
# secret (relay/service/home.py), and the service's DNS server answers it. No house holds a DNS
# credential, and the certificate covers this one name -- there is no wildcard anywhere under the zone.
#
# Caddy reads the result as bundle.pem through a loopback-only file server (caddy/away/on.caddy), and
# until there is one it simply has no certificate for this name: nothing else on the front door waits
# for it. A renewal lands without restarting anything. docs/away.md, *The alias that covers home*.
