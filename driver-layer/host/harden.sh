# The host as an appliance. Three things a box in somebody else's house needs that a developer's box
# does not, each one file, each written only when it differs from what is there:
#   1. a hardware watchdog, so a hung kernel reboots itself instead of waiting for a person with ssh;
#   2. a cap on every container's log, so a chatty Zigbee network cannot fill a 32 GB eMMC;
#   3. a cap on the system journal, for the same reason.
# install.sh runs this as root on every install and update. Exit 10 means the log cap is new and the
# containers have to be made again to take it (install.sh does that once); anything else non-zero is
# a real failure. Nothing here is Pi-specific except turning the Pi's watchdog on when it is off.
