# The hub's first boot, for a box that was flashed rather than installed: the Home Hub image for a
# Pi, or any machine where someone dropped this unit in. Runs once (home-hub-firstboot.service),
# leaves a mark, and never runs again. Everything Pi-specific lives here, not in install.sh, so the
# install script stays the same on a NUC, a VM, or any Debian or Fedora box.
#
#   1. On a Pi 5: bring the bootloader current and make sure PCIe is on, so an NVMe on any base works.
#   2. On a Pi 5 that booted from SD with an empty NVMe attached: copy itself to the NVMe and reboot
#      from it (HUB_AUTO_NVME=0 in /etc/home-hub.conf turns this off).
#   3. Run install.sh, which does everything a hand install would.
