# Whether a release is what the maker says it is. Sourced by install.sh; defines verify_release.
#
# The problem this exists for: install.sh used to move the checkout to whatever the newest v* tag
# pointed at and pull images by tag. Both are names somebody can move, so the answer to "what may run
# as root in this house" was "whoever can push to GitHub" -- a stolen token, a compromised Action, or
# a bad afternoon at the registry. Nothing was checked anywhere.
#
# So a release carries a small signed record of what it is (tools/release-manifest.py): the commit,
# and every image by digest. This checks the signature against a key on the host, and then the hub
# checks out the *commit the manifest names* and pulls the *digests the manifest names*. A tag that
# moves after that changes nothing, because nothing reads a tag any more.
#
# Where the key lives is the whole point. NOT in $DIR -- that is the thing being updated, so a key
# kept there could be replaced by the same push the key exists to catch. It is copied once to
# /etc/home-hub/release-key.pub, on the first install, and never overwritten afterwards. The first
# install trusts the repository it is being installed from; every update after it trusts the key.
# That boundary is real and worth knowing: a flashed image narrows it, because the image was built
# from a tag and carries the key already.
#
# Two things this deliberately does not do. It does not verify the `main` channel: there are no
# manifests for commits, a hub following a branch is a hub being worked on, and pretending otherwise
# would mean an escape hatch that ends up pasted into a house. And it has no override -- a hub that
# cannot verify a release does not install it.
# A directory, not one file, and that is a decision that cannot be taken later: a hub trusts the keys
# it was installed with and never adds one, because a key arriving from the repository afterwards is
# exactly the push this whole file exists to catch. So a second key has to be there from the first
# install or it can never be there at all -- and without one, losing the first means no hub in any
# house can be updated again, ever. Any key in here may sign a release.
