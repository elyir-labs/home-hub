# Applies an update the panel asked for, and undoes one that does not come back.
#
# home-hub-update.path starts this the moment brain-data/update.request appears. install.sh does the
# actual work (code to whichever release or commit this hub's channel points at, images pulled,
# containers restarted); update.json tells the brain, and so the panel, how it went.
#
# The undo is the reason this script is longer than the installer's call. A household's only repair
# tool is the wall, and the wall is exactly what is missing when an update does not start, so the
# hub has to put itself back rather than wait for somebody with ssh. Before anything moves, where
# the hub is now -- its commit and the image the brain container is actually running, taken from the
# daemon rather than from a file that could disagree with it -- goes into update.prev. Afterwards
# the brain has to answer on the loopback, and keep answering, or all of that is restored and the
# version that did it is named in update.json so nothing offers it again on its own.
#
# Putting it back needs no network: the old image is still in the local store. That matters, because
# a hub most likely to need the undo is a hub whose update just broke its own networking.
#
# Safe to run by hand.
