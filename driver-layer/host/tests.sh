# back when it does not start, the signature that decides what may run as root, and the hold that
# stops a bad release spreading. Until this existed CI checked their syntax and nothing more, which
# is the weakest possible guarantee about the three scripts a household most depends on and can
# least repair. docs/updates.md.

# It needs git, openssl, curl and python3 and nothing else -- no docker, no network, no root. The
