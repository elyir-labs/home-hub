# Brings the way in from outside up or down: the relay's client (frpc) and the away door on the house's
# own name (caddy/away/on.caddy). docs/away.md, step 4; design/address/ is what the household saw.
#
# home-hub-away.path starts this the moment brain-data/away.request appears. The brain writes two files
# and nothing else: away.request naming a WANT, and away.env carrying the values the house was handed
# when it claimed its name (hub/address.py). It never runs docker and holds no socket that could.
#
# THE REQUEST NAMES A WANT AND NEVER A COMMAND -- on, off, or forget -- checked here against a list
# written here. And every value in away.env is checked again, by its own pattern, before a single line
# of .env is written: these values arrive from a service on the internet by way of the brain, and .env
# is read by docker compose as root. Anything that does not match is dropped and said so in the log.
# restart.sh and update.sh make the same point; keep the three shaped alike.
#
#   on       the house's values into .env, `away` into the profiles, caddy, frpc and lan-cert up
#   off      HUB_AWAY=off, `away` out of the profiles, frpc and lan-cert gone, caddy back to the plain door
#   forget   off, and the house's name and secret taken out of .env as well
#
# On, it also writes HUB_LAN_NAME -- the house's name at home, 192-168-1-53.<house>.home.<zone> -- from
# the address this host actually has on the LAN, not HUB_IP in .env, which install.sh writes once and a
# DHCP lease can leave behind (found on the maker's hub on 2 October: .env said .42, the hub was .53).
#
# Safe to run by hand.
